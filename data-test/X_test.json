The Grand Rapids City Commission at 1 p.m. Tuesday, March 12, will be asked to recommend non-renewal of the Class C liquor license for the bar where a man was killed last year and where four people were shot last month. The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission. \u201cAfter the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,\u201d said Lt. Richard Nawrocki, who commands the police departments vice unit. \u201cBased upon the immediate community\u2019s concerns, we believe it fits the criteria for the City Commission\u2019s review for non-renewal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to prove that the activities have some correlation to the bar here, and that\u2019s what we will try to show.\u201d RELATED: Grand Rapids police want to revoke liquor license for New Roosevelt Bar, where 4 were shot last month Police say they have had to respond to incidents at 1447 Grandville Avenue SW more often since the bar got its liquor license in March 2012. The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo. The memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood. \u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it\u2019s the parking lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals.

Ronald Collins, 39, was found guilty of making a false and fictitious written statement on an ATF Form. Collins said he had never been committed to a mental institution. However, in April 2014 he was sent to the William Sharpe Hospital for psychiatric evaluation as part of a Court order signed by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Robert Burnside. \"Collins is prohibited from possessing a firearm by virtue of having previously been committed to a mental institution,\" said U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart. \"This is a prime example of how enforcing existing gun laws keeps guns out of the wrong hands. I want to thank the ATF, the West Virginia State Police and prosecutors for their exemplary work in this case.\" Collins posted several videos of himself with a firearm on social media. These were shown to the jury. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on July 10, 2019. ORIGINAL STORY: A preliminary hearing is held in federal Court on Monday, March 19, 2018 for a man accused of illegally buying a gun.

Some of the bullets went next door, striking the car in the driveway and the neighbor's front door. \"These two are under my daughter's bed,\" Antionne Nailor said as tears fell from his face just at the thought of his daughter possibly being in the path of gunfire. Antionne Nailor broke down crying while pointing out where the two bullets struck inside his daughter's bedroom and struck the girl's mother as she slept in their daughter's bed. \"She got hit in her back and in the back of her neck two shots,\" Nailor said. Their Maura Lane home is full of bullet holes after someone opened fire on the house just before 2 a.m. Since Antionne's daughter stayed at her grandmother's, the girl's mother stayed in her room for the night as Antionne picked up an extra shift at work. \"She got hit in my daughter's bed where she would have been that night,\" said Nailor. \"We all would have been here tonight. I only worked for somebody else and I didn't want to do it and if I would have been here, I would have been dead.\" There are bullet holes in the windows, the front door, and all over the front siding of Antionne's home. \"Now I have bullet holes - more than I can count,\" he said. \"More than I want to count.\" Some of the gunfire hit next door, striking the windshield of a 2010 Dodge Charger. The car's windshield has two bullet holes on the passenger side. The glass on the neighbor's front screen door also got hit. The message from Antionne to the shooter includes his suggestion to putting an end to the violence. \"Just stop. If you don't turn yourself in, just never do it again, people don't need to be hurt,\" he said. The Maura Lane gunfire is just one of many shootings in the city just the past 24 hours, which are now under investigation by IMPD.

Authorities say a Birmingham man not only botched a robbery and kidnapping, but he also accidentally shot himself in the process early Wednesday. Raphael Darnelle Roman, 28, was arrested Wednesday morning by Jefferson County sheriff's deputies. Chief Deputy Randy Christian gave this account of what happened: Deputies were dispatched just after midnight to reports of gunfire in the area of Candy Mountain Apartments off of Carson Road. When they arrived, they found Roman walking near the 900 building. They first asked him about shots being fired, and then asked him if he was armed. He took off running, and dropped a handgun as he fled. After a short foot chase, deputies caught up to him. He told them he had been shot in the leg by a man in the woods. Paramedics came to the scene to treat his injury. While this was going on, another call to the sheriff's office reported a prowler near the 400 building of the same apartment complex. Deputies went to the scene and found a 24-year-old Tarrant man who was bleeding from the head. That man told deputies he had been with Roman at a mutual friend's house in North Birmingham, and Roman had asked for a ride to a nearby convenience store. On the way to the store, Roman pulled a gun and demanded money and heroin. When the man told Roman he had neither, Roman hit him in the head with the pistol and made him take off his pants. He then forced the man into the trunk of the car. After being in the trunk for an undisclosed amount of time, the man was able to escape using the emergency release. He was at Candy Mountain Apartments, and started going door to door searching for someone to help him. Deputies charged Roman with first-degree kidnapping, first-degree assault and attempting to elude. He was taken to a local hospital to have his leg wound treated, and then was taken to the Jefferson County Jail. During questioning, Roman admitted he accidentally shot himself. He remains in the Jefferson County Jail with bond set at $126,000. \"Lets' see, he didn't get what he was after, he got caught, and he shot himself accidentally,'' Christian said. \" I would say he had a pretty bad day.

An all-too-familiar scenario of a teenager being shot while handling a weapon played out again on Tuesday in Penn Township, when police say an 18-year-old was hit in the chest with a shotgun blast during an afternoon of horseplay with a friend. Although police initially reported that Tyler Fetter of Manor suffered \u201csignificant trauma\u201d in the shooting shortly before 12:30 p.m., they later said he was listed in stable condition in Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville. A hospital spokesman was unable to provide details. Fetter and his friend, Colton Cline, 19, were \u201cgoofing around\u201d in Cline\u2019s Lux Road home when Cline picked up his Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun and pointed it at Fetter, police said in Court documents filed in the case. Not realizing the gun was loaded, Cline was moving it away from Fetter when it fired, Detective Todd DeNillo wrote in an affidavit of probable cause. Cline, who touted himself on his Facebook page as an avid hunter and lover of trucks and all-terrain vehicles, ran to his mother\u2019s nearby bedroom to tell her that he\u2019d shot Fetter and to summon help, police said. Fetter and Cline chatted on Facebook earlier this week about plans to get together. Cline was arraigned on charges of reckless endangerment and aggravated assault, and was being held in the Westmoreland County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bail. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the intent \u2026 was homicide,\u201d township police Chief John Otto said. \u201cWe believe that this was a reckless act that took place.\u201d It is a story that has been heard before in Westmoreland and Fayette counties: \u2022 Earlier this month, police charged Andrew Thomas Hustosky, 17, of Dunbar Township, Fayette County, as an adult, alleging he fatally shot William Oburn Little IV, 22, of Connellsville. Hustosky said the shooting was an accident and that he didn\u2019t think the gun was loaded. He is being held in the Fayette County Prison. \u2022 Darrell Ross, a 17-year-old Connellsville Area High School student, was fatally shot in the back of the head in Uniontown in November. Police charged Hasani Simpkins, 20, of Uniontown, who said the shooting was accidental. Simpkins is awaiting formal arraignment in Common Pleas Court. Psychologists say that teenage boys\u2019 attraction to guns is undeniable. But the outcome can be deadly, statistics show. In 2011, 15- to 19-year-old males were eight times more likely to die in a firearms-related incident than females of the same age, according to Child Trends Data Bank, a nonpartisan research center. Drive William Pollack, a Harvard University expert in the psychology of boys and young men, said there is some biological evidence that shows boys are more likely to engage in \u201caction-oriented play and more excitement-oriented play\u201d than girls. \u201cAccidental shootings with boys having guns we can stop tomorrow \u2014 if every real gun in every real house were locked in a way where you couldn\u2019t get to it if you were a child,\u201d he said. That would have to be combined with toy manufacturers not making guns that look real, and parents talking to their children about the differences between real guns and toys, he said. Otto said officers who participate in the township\u2019s Drug Abuse Resistance Education program talk to second- and fifth-graders in the Penn-Trafford School District about the potential dangers of guns. Cub Scouts who tour the police department are warned of the dangers, too, he said. \u201cWe use those opportunities as a means to preach gun safety,\u201d Otto said. \u201cWe talk about it every chance we get.\u201d Cline faces a preliminary hearing on Jan. 28 before Harrison City District Judge Helen Kistler. His parents left Kistler\u2019s Court without speaking to reporters. \u201cI think, Mr. Cline, you realize that these are very serious charges,\u201d Kistler told the teen. Cline, who told Kistler he is unemployed, has Court dates scheduled in connection with other brushes with the law. He is scheduled for a March 26 preliminary hearing before District Judge Douglas Weimer on charges of theft and receiving stolen property in connection with a Nov. 28 incident in North Huntingdon. He was free on $10,000 unsecured bail in that case, according to Court records.

Their Maura Lane home is full of bullet holes after someone opened fire on the house just before 2 a.m. Since Antionne's daughter stayed at her grandmother's, the girl's mother stayed in her room for the night as Antionne picked up an extra shift at work. \"She got hit in my daughter's bed where she would have been that night,\" said Nailor. \"We all would have been here tonight.

On January 23rd, four surveillance cameras were rolling when two armed masked men hit Joe Joe's Travel Center on Highway 78 in Red Banks. One of the robbers held a Tech-9 semi automatic pistol with an extended magazine on the store clerk while his partner grabbed all the loot from the cash register. \"If they don't get stopped, somebody going to get hurt. And that's for sure, \" said Ibraham Babukr. Babukr is the owner of Joe Joe's and says the clerk on duty the night of the robbery is lucky to be alive. \"He was terrified. He have a lot of health issues and he didn't work for two days,\" said Babukr. Babukr said the surveillance video shows a gold or silver-colored Honda cruising the parking lot before the robbers busted through the front doors, yelling and waving a gun.

The recipient of Yancey's social media messages gave screenshots of the conversation to authorities. The photos Yancey posted included himself posing with various weapons that ranged from handguns to shotguns and assault-style rifles. Part of Yancey's post read: \"Thinking about doing something. Do not know if I should. Recent events say go for it.\" Yancey's friends said they became concerned about him after he recently divorced his wife and lost his job. Deputies said Yancey was believed to be distraught over the firing and was possibly seeking retaliation. Deputies said Yancey was fired from Walmart after he was accused of sexually harassing a co-worker. The threat of Yancey doing harm to others was something deputies said they could not ignore. \u201cWe interviewed some people who had worked with him, and when we went to his home, even his family members had some concerns,\u201d Rhoden said. \u201cI believe in this case we might have prevented something terrible from happening.\" The Sheriff's Office made contact with Yancey and other family members at his home at 1:39 p.m. Saturday.

Deputies said Yancey described firearms that were his in the home, which he shares with his parents. A search warrant revealed an arsenal of handguns and high-powered assault-type rifles, along with accessories like bump stocks and extended capacity magazines. The firearms and items found included an AK-47 assault rifle, a black skull mask, gloves and clothing. Rhoden said he doesn't regret the decision to confiscate Yancey's weapons. \u201cI am a strong advocate of the 2nd Amendment, the right to bear arms and protect your family.

Authorities don't know how the child had access to the weapon they say he used to shoot his sister, but authorities said they believe the weapon belonged to the mother's live-in boyfriend. In Mississippi, there is no law that holds an adult responsible when children have access to weapons that are not secured. Cantrell said at this point it's just not clear whether there will be charges on the adults in the home, or on the 9-year-old alleged shooter. \"The juvenile Court will be in charge of what happens with him at this point. I think this is new ground for them, also,\" the sheriff said. It's also unclear how much knowledge the boy had of the dangers of guns. \"In my opinion, kids watch video games where they shoot each other and hit the reset button and they come back to life. It's not like that in the real world,\" Cantrell said. \"I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s necessarily what happened, but kids now are different than what they were when we were growing up.\" More: States rejecting bills intended to keep guns away from kids Since this case involves children, Cantrell has said his investigators will not rush the investigation. \"That\u2019s why I\u2019m not too fast to say anything because there are juveniles involved. We want to do what\u2019s right and we\u2019re going to get it right,\" he said Sunday. CLOSE Police say a 13-year old girl in Mississippi is dead after being shot in the back of head Saturday by her 9-year old brother, after she refused to give up her video game controller.

DeCory DeMarco Downing, 20, of Macomb County, has been charged with attempted murder and use of a firearm in commission of a felony, said Bruce Borkovich, university director of public safety. Downing was arrested after a standoff at the Finch Court apartment complex late Saturday night. The standoff followed a daylong manhunt around Big Rapids that included a partial campus lockdown. Police allege Downing shot a male Ferris student in the arm in the parking lot of the Venlo Place apartments after an argument about 4:15 a.m. on Saturday, Feb. 1. Borkovich declined to identify the victim, who was treated at Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids and released. The student was shot in the arm and the bullet entered his abdomen. A female whom police believe was involved in the incident somehow was arrested along with Downing following the standoff. Her identity is being withheld pending formal charges, said Borkovich. A third woman in the apartment where Downing was found was not arrested. Downing is likely to face additional charges later in the week after Mecosta County prosecutors are able to review the evidence and police reports. The .380 handgun police believe was used by Downing was recovered in a vehicle belonging to the woman who was arrested. Downing has an \u201cextensive criminal record,\u201d said Borkovich. Police do not yet know a motive in the shooting, he said. Investigators are trying to determine what brought the two men together in the Venlo Apartments parking lot. There was a party nearby at the time, but Borkovich said it's not clear whether both men were at the party or even knew each other. \"Early indications are that it may have just been an argument that went bad,\" he said. Downing is not a Ferris State student and has no apparent ties to the area, he said. Borkovich would not comment on the victim's status at Ferris other than to say the male student is in his 20s and is not originally from Big Rapids. Borkovich credited a multi-agency effort for the quick apprehension of Downing. Michigan State Police tactical and K-9 units, and a BearCat vehicle from the Grand Rapids Police Department aided in the suspect search, he said. Shootings in Big Rapids are \"very rare,\" he said. \"This is a nice community; a safe place,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, this behavior shows up everywhere.

Following a multijurisdictional investigation that included assistance by the FBI, the three men were arrested Wednesday in Paxton, Loda and suburban Berwyn. Ford County State's Attorney Matt Fitton has charged Rodolfo A. Cerritos, 25, of Paxton, Evigan J. Marcos, 24, of Loda and Eduardo Samano, 22, of Berwyn with one count each of armed robbery, a Class X felony; kidnapping, a Class 2 felony; and aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony. Cerritos and Marcos remained at the Ford County Jail on Thursday, while Paxton Police Chief Bob Bane said he was notified that as of 9 a.m. Samano was in the custody of Berwyn police. Bond is set at $250,000 for Samano, and Fitton said he has asked Judge Paul Lawrence to set the same bond amount for Cerritos and Marcos. Preliminary hearings have not been set. According to a criminal complaint from Paxton police filed in court, the victim reported to police that on Dec. 9, he was abducted by two Hispanic men \u2014 later identified as Marcos and Cerritos \u2014 as he was leaving the business where he works in Paxton. The kidnappers used a pistol and a baseball bat to force him into a vehicle by \"hitting him in the head multiple times,\" the complaint said. They then drove around Ford and Iroquois counties threatening to kill him and his family. \"The gentleman was held for hours, beaten and extorted for money,\" Bane said. \"During this time, they struck (the victim) with the bat and pistol,\" police said in the complaint. \"They stuck a gun to (his) head and dry-fired the pistol twice.\" The kidnappers agreed to let the victim leave if he provided $800 in cash to them the following day by dropping it in a garbage can at the park in Loda. They had already allegedly robbed him of $300, several credit cards, a cellphone, two checks totaling $8,000, a GPS unit and external computer hard drive. Samano, who was not in the vehicle throughout the incident but allegedly \"set everything up,\" later picked up Cerritos and Marcos \"from the scene,\" the complaint said. Paxton police asked for the FBI's assistance in investigating the incident. On Wednesday, the victim was asked to leave $50,000 in the same garbage can at the park, and the FBI \"covered\" the funds, the complaint said. Cerritos then collected it from the park on Wednesday, the complaint said. Cerritos was arrested by Paxton police, FBI agents and state police during a traffic stop in the 200 block of North Market Street on Wednesday, Bane said. The complaint said Cerritos confessed to his involvement and named Samano and Marcos as others involved, adding that Samano \"planned everything.\" Marcos was arrested later Wednesday by Paxton police, FBI agents and state police at his home in the 200 block of South Elm Street in Loda. Police then obtained an arrest warrant for Samano late Wednesday night, and he was arrested Thursday morning in Berwyn by Berwyn police and the U.S. Marshal Service. The Ford County Sheriff's Office was expected to pick him up for transfer to the Ford County Jail later Thursday. If convicted, all three men face a potential sentence of six to 30 years in prison for the most serious of the charges, the Class X felony. Bane said Cerritos was charged additionally with driving on a revoked license and possession of drug paraphernalia. In addition to the FBI's Champaign office and Illinois State Police, Bane said, Paxton police were assisted by the Iroquois County Sheriff's Office, the Ford County Sheriff's Office and the Gibson City Police Department.", "publish_date": "2014-01-16"}, {"text": "Police are investigating whether or not the deadly shooting of a Riverside doctor was an act of self-defense or an act of malice.

Moten was charged with attempted first-degree murder, accused of shooting a 20-year-old man in eastern New Orleans on Jan. 13, 2014. (OPSO) A Louisiana Tech University student was sentenced to 18 years in prison Wednesday (July 15), after he admitted to shooting his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend in eastern New Orleans because of an Instagram feud. Dorrell T. Moten, 20, who lived in Monroe and was trying out for the university's basketball team when he was arrested last year, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder in the Jan. 13, 2014, shooting that police said his girlfriend orchestrated. Moten's attorney, Adam Beckman, declined to comment after the guilty plea. Had he gone to trial, Moten would have had to confront Earlneishka Johnson, his girlfriend who pleaded guilty last month to her role in the crime and agreed to testify against him. She received a three-year prison sentence on June 2. According to the New Orleans Police Department, Johnson called her ex-boyfriend just after midnight, asking if he wanted to hang out. He agreed, and she picked him up at his home near Read Boulevard and drove him to the 13000 block of Sevres Street, where Moten waited, police said. Once there, Johnson told the victim her uncle wanted to know who was in the car with her. So the victim got out of the car and lit a cigarette. That's when Moten and another person who hasn't been identified approached him, he told police. \"You remember me? What's up with all that?\" Moten asked the victim, according to the arrest affidavit. \"All what?\" the victim replied. \"With all that Instagram bucking,\" Moten reportedly said.

He collapsed at a nearby residence, where someone called 911. The victim later identified Moten and Johnson.

Johnson was charged with being a principal to attempted first-degree murder, but her attorney and the prosecutor, Robert Ferrier, reached the plea agreement.

T'xer Zhon Kha/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin WAUSAU - A 35-year-old man apparently shot himself to death after police chased him into his home on Wausau's northeast side because they were concerned he was suicidal. Officers didn't discover the man dead until about six hours later when they entered the home with a search warrant, Wausau Police Chief Ben Bliven said in an evening press conference at the city Public Safety Building. Police had been searching for the man for 24 hours \u2014 based on a report that he threatened to harm himself \u2014 when officers spotted him driving away from the home in the 700 block of Augusta Avenue at 12:05 p.m. Wednesday, Bliven said. Officers tried to pull him over, but he drove back to his house and ran inside. Moments later, police heard a gunshot from inside the house. \"The ending of this incident is obviously not what we hoped for,\" Bliven said. \"It's heartbreaking for the family, and our thoughts and prayers are with them.\" Police did not release the man's name but said they had been in contact with family members. The house is north of East Wausau Avenue, along a Sreett behind Lamb's Fresh Market grocery store. The chief said police surrounded the home and blocked streets for hours before they went inside \u2014 even though they heard the gunshot immediately and there were no further sounds from the home \u2014 because they wanted to make sure the danger had passed. Bliven said the man had previously threatened not only himself but \"also made statements that he would kill police officers.\" They later determined that no one else was in danger during the incident and that no one else was injured, Bliven said. Because the Marathon County SWAT team was initially away at a training exercise, SWAT units from Wood County and Marshfield assisted. An armored vehicle with a battering ram affixed to the front approached the home from a back alley shortly before 5 p.m. Wednesday, while armed officers shielded themselves behind it and followed on foot. Meanwhile, other officers operated a remote-controlled robot that approached the house from the front. Police used an amplified speaker at one point to try to communicate with the man. Bliven said they never received a response. About 6:15 p.m., one of the officers told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that there was no threat to public safety and that the incident was expected to end soon. Moments later, law enforcement vehicles began to leave the area. Throughout the day, police were telling people to stay away from the area around Augusta Avenue between Seventh and Eighth streets. They blocked off Turner Street and Augusta Avenue and took cover behind their squad vehicles. One bystander, Mitch Siewert, said he had dropped off his toddler daughter Wednesday morning at his mother-in-law's home across the Sreett from the scene. He was anxious to get his child back, but the Sreett blockade kept him away. Siewert said he had met a man who lives in the house and thought he was a nice person, but knew little else about him. Rich Dyer, who lives nearby on Brown Street, said police activity in the neighborhood is common but something was different starting Tuesday night. Dyer said he saw multiple K-9 units in the area for a period of time, but they left later in the evening. A Wausau Police Department log entry said officers were called to the 700 block of Augusta Avenue at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to investigate \"threats of self-harm.\" No other details were provided in that report. RELATED: Bomb squad responds to downtown Wausau, evacuates While police and SWAT units were responding to Augusta Avenue, other local law enforcement officers were called to the 400 Block park in downtown Wausau for an unrelated bomb scare. Police shut down a block of Third Street, evacuated the city square and called in a bomb squad. But within 45 minutes, they determined that a box found inside a planter, which had raised concern, was harmless. The Marathon County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident on Augusta Avenue, Bliven said, because state law requires that police agencies not review their own officer-involved shooting deaths. Because Wausau police were trying to approach the man at the time of his death, this case fits that description, the chief said.

(Photo: JOSH MORGAN/Staff)Buy Photo A man is dead and four Greenville County deputies have been placed on leave after an officer-involved shooting in the Poe Mill community Monday. Deputies said Jermaine Massey, 35, charged at them with a knife after they responded to Massey's home on 3rd Avenue for a reported disturbance. Massey was struck at least once and was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital where he died. The State Law Enforcement Division was asked to investigate. The four deputies involved have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation, per department protocol. \"We're very much still investigating,\" SLED spokesman Thom Berry said. \"We left the scene late last night and are working the case today. We are still in the process of collecting information.\" Greenville County Sheriff Will Lewis said a 911 call came in about 5:31 p.m. about a disturbance at 234 3rd Avenue. He said about 10 minutes later, deputies got to the scene and found a man who was \"very agitated\" and armed with \"something similar to a butcher's knife.\" Officers tried to talk to him to get the knife out of the his hand, Lewis said. There were at least five people in the home, \"potential hostage victims,\" so deputies tried to get them out as quickly as they could, Lewis said. Deputies called for backup around 5:45 p.m., he said. When the other deputies arrived and negotiations failed, deputies tried \"less lethal options.\" Those options also failed, Lewis said. A short while later the man turned to the officers and began to charge at them with a knife, Lewis said. Berry said a SLED agent was present for Massey's autopsy. He said evidence is being taken to a lab for testing as part of an investigation. He said only one dashboard camera was recording from a deputy's vehicle.

That vehicle was parked in front of the home and the incident primarily took Place behind the home, Berry said. The other vehicles that responded did not have lights and sirens activated so the dashboard cameras were not recording. Berry said he was unsure if the deputies were wearing body cameras. Sgt. Ryan Flood, a Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman, declined to release the identities of the deputies involved. A request for the 911 call was also denied. The Greenville News has also requested a copy of the dashboard camera from the scene. Bruce Wilson, founder of Fighting Injustice Together, said Massey\u2019s family has reached out to the nonprofit to seek assistance in getting the Sheriff\u2019s Office and SLED to release video footage and 911 communications. \u201cThe biggest focus now is body cam footage being released and the 911 tape,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing, to make sure nothing is compromised.

The most recent fatal shooting involving the Sheriff's Office was Nov. 19, 2017, when four deputies were placed on leave after firing at 27-year-old Jacob McCarty at the end of a vehicle chase. The 13th Circuit Solicitor's Office cleared the deputies of any criminal wrongdoing in that case. Authorities said deputies used less-than-lethal tactics to subdue McCarty first before McCarty brandished a pistol and the deputies fired shots. On Oct. 16, 2017, 32-year-old Michael Chappell was killed during what was described by authorities as a hostage situation in Simpsonville. Greenville County deputies fired at Chappell when he came out of a house with a hostage. The hostage was not injured. In February 2017, deputies shot and killed Jason Mendez, 37, of Fountain Inn, after demanding that he get out of a vehicle. Deputies were cleared in that case months later.

Officers responded about 6:40 p.m. to the We Buy Gold store at 3301 Middlefield Road in the North Fair Oaks area after a caller reported hearing multiple gunshots fired in the business, Rosenblatt said. While the store was locked when officers arrived, they looked through the window and saw four men and a toddler inside. According to Rosenblatt, the suspects, who own the business, initially refused to open the door. Once they made their way inside, officers checked for injured persons and found that nobody had been hurt. A search of the business turned up a series of firearms, including automatic rifles, shotguns and handguns, along with shell casings and stolen computer equipment, Rosenblatt said.

Authorities would not say which of the men was the father of the boy, who was released to his mother. The other two men in the store were cleared of any criminal involvement and released. It was not immediately clear why the men fired the weapons inside of the store, nor if they were shooting at each other, Rosenblatt said.

Police, including a Maine State Police tactical team, surrounded the home for several hours, according to a news release Monday from Chief Deputy James Ross of the Somerset County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Authorities heard a single gunshot around 2 a.m. and entered the home about 4 a.m., finding Picard\u2019s body. In a telephone interview Monday morning, Gary Mosher, of Mercer, said his wife, Michelle, is Gary Picard\u2019s sister and they live less than 2 miles from the Picard home where Picard lived with his girlfriend. Mosher said that had his wife been called during the nearly 12-hour standoff she might have been able to talk her brother safely out of the house. \u201cShe kind of keeps an eye on Gary,\u201d Mosher said. \u201cHe\u2019s a 50-year-old, he doesn\u2019t work \u2014 he\u2019d like to, but he\u2019s an alcoholic \u2014 and met up with his girlfriend who\u2019s absolutely poison and now he\u2019s become violent.\u201d Mosher said Picard and his girlfriend got into a heated argument \u201clike they usually do\u201d and she called police. He said Picard is not allowed to have a gun because he has a previous criminal conviction. The gun, mixed with alcohol, was going to mean trouble, he said. \u201cGolly gee, it\u2019s a human being, you know?\u201d Mosher said. \u201cThe only way we found out about it was I went to work and my wife was on her way to work and she goes down his Road and she saw all the police cars and she stopped and that\u2019s when they informed her that he had killed himself.\u201d Mosher said he thought it was police protocol to call next of kin in such a situation. \u201cShe was just not notified. We\u2019re befuddled,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe that they wouldn\u2019t get a hold of her because she knows she could have talked him out of this. He listens to everything she says. It just killed her to Drive by and know that they were there 12 hours and we live 2 miles away and were never contacted.\u201d Michelle Mosher, the postmaster at the Belgrade Lakes post office, said she, too, wondered why she was not notified of the incident as it was being played out not far from her home. \u201cI talked to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and they said it\u2019s not their protocol to call in any family members because it puts them in danger,\u201d Michelle Mosher said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about that, of course.\u201d She said she and her husband are not on good terms with the girlfriend, so she is not surprised the girlfriend didn\u2019t call them. \u201cI would have been the only person that could\u2019ve talked to him,\u201d she said. Gary Mosher said later Monday that his wife spoke with state police and was told that \u201cthey would have loved to have somebody help them\u201d but when they interviewed Picard\u2019s girlfriend, she did not mention Michelle Mosher as being a family member who could have helped. Steve McCausland, spokesman for Maine Department of Public Safety, which includes state police, said that while the incident was a Somerset County Sheriff\u2019s Office case, he would surmise that the girlfriend was considered next of kin in that situation. \u201cWhen we send the tactical team, we also send a team of negotiators, which did attempt to make contact with him during the incident before a shot was heard by the troopers and the deputies who were on scene,\u201d McCausland said by phone Monday. \u201cSometimes we regard the girlfriend as the closest relative \u2014 even though she\u2019s not married \u2014 that would, depending on who she chooses to call, would call other relatives.\u201d Ross at the sheriff\u2019s office said later Monday in an email that the incident was in the hands of the state police tactical team and the negotiators. \u201cNone of the deputies that I have spoken with had any knowledge of who she is or that she was his sister,\u201d Ross said. \u201cOnce the State Police Tactical Team arrive and take over the scene they are in charge of what is done.\u201d Somerset County deputies Cpl. Gene Cole and Isaac Wacome were dispatched to address a report of a domestic assault at Picard\u2019s home just after 4 p.m. Sunday, according to the release. The deputies were told that the person alleged to have committed the domestic assault \u2014 Picard \u2014 was intoxicated and had reportedly gone back inside to retrieve a firearm. The caller, a woman who was also the alleged victim of the assault, said she had left the house in a vehicle but was broken down on Rome Road a short distance from and within sight of Picard\u2019s home. Deputies interviewed the woman about the domestic assault and probable cause was established for Picard\u2019s arrest, according to Ross. After making sure the woman was safe and not in need of medical attention, the deputies went to Picard\u2019s home where the domestic assault was reported to have taken Place and tried to make contact with Picard. Deputies knocked on the doors, used the public address system on the cruisers, called Picard\u2019s cell phone several times and tried sending text messages, according to Ross. Picard did not respond to any of these contact attempts. Conditions of Picard\u2019s deferred disposition issued by the Court ordered that he not have any contact with the woman involved in Sunday\u2019s incident, not use or possess alcohol and not possess any firearms. Due to the nature of the call, the possible possession of a firearm by Gary Picard and his refusal to communicate with law enforcement, the decision was made by patrol supervisors to request the assistance of the Maine State Police negotiators and tactical team. Deputies also contacted the Somerset County District Attorney\u2019s Office for assistance in obtaining a search warrant for Picard\u2019s home and an arrest warrant. At approximately 9:30 p.m. Sunday a judge authorized the search warrant and arrest warrant for Gary Picard and the scene was turned over to the tactical team and negotiators.

Ross said Picard did signal several times during the night by flashing an outside light that he did not want to cooperate. He also let the family dog out.

Officers were called about 11:30 p.m. Thursday to the 300 block of East 88th Avenue, the Renaissance 88 Apartments, on a domestic violence report that included possible gunfire at the residence, according to a Thornton Police Department media release. When officers arrived, a suspect was seen driving out of the complex, police said. Officers pursued the driver to Denver and then back to the apartment complex, where the incident concluded in the fatal shooting. Several residents of the complex who witnessed the incident took video on their cell phones and passed them along to police investigators. Some of those witnesses described the police response as excessive. \u201cThere were people out here walking around and they were shooting \u2014 boom, boom boom!\u201d said LaVonne Rodriguez, 42, a resident. After multiple shots were fired, perhaps as many as 20, Rodriguez said, officers starting yelling at people to \u201cget inside.\u201d \u201cIt was unreal \u2014 it was like the end of the world the way the cops were shooting,\u201d Rodriguez said. She and other residents said Friday morning they were thankful gunfire didn\u2019t spray a nearby building. Residents said they know the man who was fatally shot and said he lived in the complex. Police identified him Friday afternoon as 35-year-old Wesley Maldonado. Sgt. Matt Kandt, a Thornton Police Department spokesman, said one shot was fired at the residence during the alleged domestic violence incident. A second shot was fired by the suspect some time during the 30-minute pursuit, but investigators aren\u2019t certain when or where that happened, Kandt said. In the apartment parking lot, police said, the SUV appeared to intentionally hit two police cars. More than one officer said Maldonado pointed a firearm at officers as they approached the SUV, prompting four officers to open fire, Kandt said. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene; no one else was injured. Police said a gun that had recently been fired was found in his vehicle. Maldonado has a lengthy arrest record in the state, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation database. In October, he was arrested in Adams County on misdemeanor domestic violence. Maldonado was also arrested at least twice, once in 2008 in Arvada and in 2009 in Jefferson County, on charges of possession of an illegal weapon. He pleaded guilty in the 2008 case and was sentenced to three years probation. A 2011 arrest in Denver included a habitual traffic offender charge and several arrests over the years were illegal drug charges. Witnesses said Friday the man driving the SUV was gone less than 45 minutes when he circled back. By that time, many residents had come out of their homes to inquire about the initial incident. The witnesses said the driver entered the 180-unit complex on the west end and sped through the parking lot. Resident Russell Schloss said he watched from a bedroom window as the SUV sped back toward East 88th Avenue and an exit. \u201cA Denver cop (car) rammed him and spun him out,\u201d Schloss said. By that time the SUV was smoking, a tire, or tires, were shredded in the incident and sparks were flying from the under carriage. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to get much further,\u201d Schloss said. \u201cHe was going on rims.\u201d Brad Jantz, 20, said he was in front of his building when he saw the SUV racing through the lot leaving a trail of smoke. \u201cIt slammed into a cop car,\u201d Jantz said. The collision was followed by shots, which sent Jantz scrambling for safety. \u201cIt was pretty crazy,\u201d Jantz said. \u201cThere was so much smoke, you couldn\u2019t seen 10 feet in front of you.\u201d Another witness questioned the level of response. \u201cIt was just not right,\u201d resident Harold McBride said of the shooting. \u201cThey (police) could have blocked him in.\u201d Neighbors said a woman who lived with the man was extremely distraught after the incident and was taken away from the complex by emergency responders.

Then he tried to \"pull the earrings out of her ear even as she was holding her three-year-old child,\" the prosecutor added.

Defense lawyer Ivonne Vidal asked for $5,000 bail, and opposed revoking her client's release in the earlier cases. The two suspects in the alleged home invasion were described as black males in their 20s, both wearing black hoodies, with one being taller and skinnier than the other, Vidal said. Awosika is neither in his 20s nor skinny, Vidal pointed out. \"There is a significant difference between the person described to police and the person standing here today,\" Vidal said. As for the vehicle, it is not unusual to see Chrysler 100s or cars with New Jersey plates in the area, Vidal said. She also raised the possibility that Awosika will provide a witness to vouch for his presence elsewhere at the time of the alleged robbery, Vidal said. A Springfield native, Awosika has a close family ties, as shown by his mother, brother and fiance coming to Court Monday to support him, Vidal said. Before his arrest Friday, Awosika was employed and was scheduled to start a new job on Monday, the lawyer said. Hadley set bail at $50,000 and revoked the defendant's bail in the 2017 case. The judge also found probable cause that Awosika violated his probation in the 2016 case and ordered him held for a violation hearing.

Houston police investigators talking to witnesses said that they heard shots around 11 pm last night. ... more Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Houston police investigate separate fatal shootings of cab driver, man in ditch 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Houston homicide detectives have their hands full with two separate investigations in the deaths of two men in unrelated cases early Friday morning. In the most recent case, a cab driver was discovered dead about 7:20 a.m. slumped over in his taxi in a parking area in front of the Camden Vanderbilt apartments at 7300 Brompton near Bellefontaine in southwest Houston, according to the Houston Police Department. Police said he had been shot the night before and investigators are reviewing surveillance video from the apartment complex. The cab driver had dropped off a fare about 11 p.m. at the apartments, said HPD Sgt. W.L. Meeler. A short time later more than one suspect approached him as he sat in his cab. The suspects, Meeler said, appeared to have walked to the cab from the street. The driver and the suspects had a disturbance and the cab driver got out of the car. Then he was shot. He got back into his cab. The suspects left after the gunfire. It's unclear if the suspects took anything from the cab or the driver. A person who said he had seen the cab parked at the complex Thursday night noticed it parked at the same spot Friday morning. He contacted police, who were originally dispatched to the scene about a person down. Initially, it was not known how he died and it was believed he may have died from natural causes. However, Meeler said, when homicide investigators arrived, they realized he had been shot. No gun was found at the scene. Meeler said investigators don't believe the fare the cab driver had taken to the complex was involved in the shooting. Residents in the neighborhood said the shooting was troubling to them. They said the area is usually quiet and seems safe. David Escarzaga said he lives a few doors down from where the shooting happened. He just moved to the neighborhood about five months ago from El Paso and likes the serenity he found in his new community. But with the killing occurring so close to his front door, he said, it makes him realize how dangerous a big city can be. \"It's a little worrisome,\" he said. In the other shooting, a man was found dead about 6 a.m. lying in a ditch at 4006 Phlox near Duane in south Houston. He had been shot. Police said a passerby spotted the man and called 911.

However, he would later admit to the shooting and claimed that he threw the gun into a sewer. A search of the sewer where Diaz said he threw the weapon ended with negative results. Police, however, did recover more than 50 pounds of marijuana inside his apartment. Diaz was initially tried in March of this year, but it ended in a mistrial when a juror became unable to continue while deliberations were underway. A jury convicted Diaz last month of criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of marijuana and tampering with physical evidence. \u201cThe lengthy prison sentence imposed by the Court punishes the defendant for the crimes that he committed.

Henry Okongo, 51, and Lydiah Okongo, 40, were found inside 2 Mina Drive suffering from gunshot wounds, the Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez said yesterday. Lydiah Okongo was found on the first floor with multiple gunshot wounds to her head and torso and Henry Okongo was found in the basement with a gunshot wound to the head, Suarez said. They were pronounced dead at the scene around 10 a.m. Two of the couple's children, a 3-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl, were found inside the home by responding officers, Suarez said, adding that the uninjured boy was taken to Jersey City Medical Center for evaluation. Neighbors, who asked not to be identified, said Lydiah Okongo worked as a nurse and Henry Okongo owned a few laundromats. Public records show Henry Okongo owned a business on Martin Luther King Drive. Hundreds of residents rallied around Henry Okongo to help him save his business in 2013 when his lease was up and he was behind in rent. Henry Okongo is listed as the owner of both 2 Mina Drive -- a corner house -- and 120 Sycamore Road, which stands just behind the other home on the opposite corner. Homicide detectives could be seen sifting through the mail boxes at the Sycamore Road home. Friends say Henry Okongo's brother once lived in the other home but moved to North Carolina. A gun was recovered from the home, sources said, and neighbors say another adult family member lived with the Okongos. The state's Regional Medical Examiner arrived at the scene just before noon yesterday. One body was removed out the front door and the second was brought out from a back door. A white Honda Accord with New York license plates that was parked across the Sreett from the Mina Drive home was towed from the scene and seized by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office. Neighbors estimate the couple lived in the home for at least a decade. They were described as \"lovely people\" who were hard working. No one would have expected a tragedy like this to come from that home, residents said.

(Stephen Dethrage | al.com) LAKE VIEW, Alabama -- The man accused of fatally shooting a 40-year-old Tuscaloosa man on I-20/59 Thursday night may have been racing him minutes before the murder, the commander of the Tuscaloosa Metro Homicide Unit said Friday morning. Sgt. Dale Phillips said witness accounts and physical evidence have led investigators to believe that the two men were racing each other down the southbound lanes of the interstate at high speeds when contact was made between their two vehicles. Phillips said there is no evidence to suggest the contact was intentional, but it was enough to destabilize both vehicles and the men wrecked into each other then into the concrete median dividing the interstate before coming to a stop near Exit 100, just outside of Lake View, Ala. 37-year-old Roderick Dale Washington, Jr. is charged with capital murder for the shooting death of a 40-year-old Tuscaloosa man.Investigators say the two were racing down I-20 at high speeds, collided and wrecked their vehicles before Washington shot the other driver. (Tuscaloosa County Jail) After the accident, the suspect exited his now-totaled Chevrolet Impala and walked over to his victim's wrecked Nissan Altima. Sgt. Phillips says evidence suggests he shot the other driver one time while his victim was still in his vehicle. The wounded man, 40-year-old Frederick Lee Blakely , got out of his car but collapsed on the ground and was found dead on the scene. When Lake View police officers and Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly after, they found 37-year-old Roderick Dale Washington, Jr. , the driver of the wrecked Impala. Washington suffered minor injuries in the crash and was taken to DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa for treatment. Since then, Phillips said evidence and witness reports gathered gave investigators reason to charge Washington with capital murder. He was taken in to custody and booked in the Tuscaloosa County Jail, where he will be held without bond. Phillips said there was no indication that the men knew each other before they began racing on the interstate Thursday night. He said it was unlikely that the two had a predetermined start and finish line for their race and the contest of speed was probably a spontaneous one initiated on the road. Phillips said the car accident was the sole result of the high rate of speed and carelessness of the drivers, and the state's recent winter weather woes did not come into play. Washington has three speeding tickets against him on record in the Alabama courts system, the most recent written in 2006. He has also had a pistol he was not licensed to carry seized by the Homewood Police Department in 2009, but his Court records don't show a history of violence in the state. Traffic was stopped on I-20/59's southbound lanes for a few hours after the shooting as investigators combed through evidence on the scene and interviewed witnesses. Vehicles were backed up for miles, and Phillips apologized for that, but said the investigation had to be done on the scene and it had to be done thoroughly.", "publish_date": "2014-01-31"}, {"text": "RIVERDALE, Ga - Two men were shot while sitting in a parked vehicle Wednesday afternoon, and police said one of the men has died.

In exchange for his pleas, the prosecution agreed to dismiss two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and single counts of larceny in a building, first-degree home invasion, felony firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon. A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for the purposes of sentencing. One of Brown's codefendants, 20-year-old Sammie L. Wright III, followed his friend's lead and on Thursday, May 29, also pleaded no contest to armed robbery in exchange for the dismissal of larceny in a building, first-degree home invasion, felony firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon. Armed robbery is a life offense. In Cobbs hearings for each man, Bay County Chief Circuit Judge Kenneth W. Schmidt indicated their minimum sentence would not exceed 12 years in prison. The pair's codefendants \u2014 Nashawn D. Lane, 18, and Antonio D. Griffin, 19 \u2014 are scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday, June 3. Schmidt is presiding. Each of them is charged with armed robbery, first-degree home invasion, larceny in a building, assault with a dangerous weapon and felony firearm. Prosecutors contend the quartet on the evening of Jan. 14 broke into the Bay City apartment of Rufus Smith. A woman who was there at the time testified in a February preliminary examination that four to six masked and armed men barged into the residence. She said one of the men, whom she identified as Brown, took her into a bathroom and raped her. The woman said she was at Smith's Place to buy marijuana, but hadn't actually made the purchase when the intruders arrived. Smith testified in the same hearing that the invaders demanded drugs and money, but he managed to break away from them and flee outside. He said he ran to a neighbor's house to call 911 and did not know the woman was still inside. Smith said he later discovered two TVs, two watches, cologne, marijuana, prescription medicine and cash were missing. Prosecutors also allege that three days later, on the evening of Jan. 17, the men accosted Lori Davis as she backed her car out of her Bay City driveway. Davis testified in a March continuation of the preliminary examination that two of the men approached her car and asked for directions, then one pulled a long gun. Davis said she laid on her car horn and the man took off on foot. Police arrested all four men that same night, after officers observed them exiting an area house. Bay City Public Safety Detective Nate Kamp testified in March that in subsequent interviews, each defendant said he was at Smith's home on Jan. 14, and that Brown said he had some sexual contact with a woman there. Schmidt is to sentence Brown at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, July 7, and Wright at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, July 21.", "publish_date": "2014-05-30"}, {"text": "An Orlando man faces several felony charges \u2014 including attempted first-degree murder \u2014 after deputies say a botched home invasion landed him in the hospital after the victim fought back. On March 6, deputies responded to a home invasion on Cabo San Lucas Drive, near Texas Avenue and Americana Boulevard. The victim told authorities that two men started following him home after he bought a coffee at a nearby convenience store. When the victim reached the door of his apartment, one of the men pulled out a revolver, demanded money, and struck him in the stomach several times with the gun, according to Court documents. The men then asked the victim where he lived and took away his apartment keys. He pleaded with the men to allow him to move his mother \u2014 who had suffered from a stroke \u2014 from the living room. After the victim moved his mother, one of the suspects shoved the revolver in his ribs, followed the man into his bedroom and asked for guns and money, deputies said. Eventually, the victim shoved the man holding the gun and punched him in the face.

Three gunshots were heard during the fight and the suspects fled the apartment with the victim\u2019s cell phone. Responding deputies found a trail of blood in the apartment. No guns, drugs or large amount of cash were found, deputies said. Later in the day, Tierre Charles, 32, showed up at Central Florida Regional Hospital with several women claiming he had been shot in a drive-by shooting. He had a bullet wound in his chest, deputies said.

Last Thursday, Demetrius Rashad Foster was booked in the county jail and for his connection to the shooting, and Sgt. Dale Phillips, the commander of the homicide unit, announced another arrest in the case this afternoon. 18-year-old Charles Mackennly Nelson Jr. was arrested Wednesday and charged with capital murder for the January slaying of a 24-year-old Tuscaloosa man. He is being held without bond in the county jail. (Tuscaloosa County Jail) 18-year-old Charles Mackennly Nelson Jr. was arrested Wednesday and also charged with capital murder. Both men are being held in the Tuscaloosa County Jail without bond. New details in the case have also emerged thanks to a deposition filed in the Court case against Foster. According to that document, Gardner went to a home on 20th Street in West Tuscaloosa on Jan. 9 with $2,400 in cash to buy more than a pound of marijuana. A witness in the car with Gardner told investigators he went inside to buy the drugs and came out around 10 minutes later, running from two men. The witness said one was carrying a pistol, and the other was armed with what appeared to be a semiautomatic assault rifle. The deposition says Gardner got in the car and began to Drive away when a shot was fired into the vehicle. Gardner said he'd been hit and switched seats with his passenger, who drove the wounded man to DCH Regional Medical Center, where he was treated for a gunshot wound to his chest. Although Gardner was originally expected to survive the shooting, his condition worsened over the next few weeks. . In a press conference Thursday, Sgt. Phillips said the two arrested men were charged with capital murder because Gardner was shot while he was in a vehicle, and his killing may have been a part of a botched attempt to rob him. Both of those factors warrant a capital murder charge. \"When you have an event such as this and there's more than one person involved, everyone involved is charged with the same crime, though that doesn't mean down the Road they'll be convicted of the same thing,\" Phillips said. \"Anyone arrested in the case will probably be charged with capital murder.\" Phillips said the case is on-going and more witnesses have to be interviewed, but he added that his investigators believe they know which of the two men arrested so far pulled the trigger that night in January and ultimately killed Joshua Gardner.", "publish_date": "2014-02-20"}, {"text": "PALM COAST, Fla. - Three men and a juvenile have been arrested in connection with the burglary of a home on Pine Brook Drive in Palm Coast on Sunday afternoon.

The man has not yet been arraigned on the charges. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating the man and obtained a federal warrant Wednesday, Jan. 15, to search his home on the 2000 block of Terrace Drive near Dort Highway, according to an affidavit filed in the case by an ATF agent. However, Flint police were dispatched to the man's home Jan. 15 for a report of shots fired before federal agents could search the house, according to the affidavit. When Flint police arrived on the scene the man allegedly told them that a woman called his house and asked to borrow money. When the woman arrived at the home the man opened the door and three men entered the home. The 45-year-old man allegedly told federal investigators that he and the men exchanged gunfire in and around the home, according to the affidavit. Authorities said it was apparent that multiple rounds were fired inside the residence from more than one caliber of firearm. The house was processed by Flint police evidence technicians and was eventually searched by federal agents, according to the affidavit. Federal investigators allegedly discovered roughly 68 grams of heroin that was broken up and packaged into different sized amounts and a .45-caliber handgun that was reported stolen out of Burton. Court records show that the suspect was convicted in 1990 in Genesee Circuit Court of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and in 2004 in federal Court for being a felon in possession of a firearm.

The shootings occurred about 75 minutes and a half-mile apart late Sunday. The first was just before 10 p.m. in the 3600 block of Reisterstown Road in the Park Circle neighborhood. A man was shot in the head and died at a hospital a short time later, police said. At 11:15 p.m., police were dispatched to a shooting in the 3900 block of Edgewood Road in the East Arlington neighborhood. The victim had been shot several times and died at a hospital before midnight, police said. Police did not identify either of the victims or provide a possible motive. The incidents capped a weekend that saw eight people shot across the city, three of them fatally. Among the victims was 28-year-old Ricky Mellerson, who was found shot early Saturday in a vehicle that flipped over while traveling through Mount Vernon on East Madison Street. Police confirmed Monday that Mellerson was leaving the Casablanca Hookah Lounge in the 800 block of Guilford Avenue when the shooting occurred and that a female passenger was in the overturned vehicle. No additional details were provided and no arrests have been made. Three people were also stabbed early Sunday after a melee at a downtown club. Police Department data shows that even amid the spate of killings, other crime is down considerably to start the year. Robberies through Jan. 11 were down 49 percent, with 69 robberies compared with 135 at the same time last year. The statistics show aggravated assaults were down 23 percent, burglaries were down 23 percent, and larcenies were down 39 percent. But homicides, with 16 through Sunday, were up, compared with five at the same time last year. Over the weekend, police identified a stabbing victim from Friday morning in the 2500 block of Frederick Avenue as 17-year-old Dejuan Willis. He is the youngest of this year's victims. And the man fatally shot in the 7000 block of McClean Boulevard on Friday evening was identified as Bennett Daniel, 35. Other victims this year have included a father and his son, along with a grocery store employee shot inside the South Smallwood Street store during a robbery.

Hopkins, police said, then barricaded himself inside the Family Tree's building on North Charles Street. Police said Hopkins then killed himself in the center, which was not occupied at the time. The center opened only to staff on Monday as it held an employee debriefing and support session with a trauma expert, Executive Director Patricia Cronin said.

Tarra Bond, 27, was taken into custody about 1:40 a.m. after she reported she had shot her boyfriend, Chevis Howard. The shooting occurred at a residence located in the 800 block of Bailey Street. Bond told officers she was defending herself against Howard when she shot him one time with a .410 gauge shotgun. The 33-year-old man sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen. He was airlifted to OU Medical Center where he underwent surgery. Sgt. Brice Woolly, Ardmore Police Department Patrol Division, said about 2 p.m. Saturday Howard was reportedly out of surgery. His condition was rated as critical. Howard's criminal record shows he pleaded guilty and served a prison sentence on an assault with a dangerous weapon charge, and is currently serving a suspended sentence after pleading guilty in 2012 to felonious possession of firearm charges. Court records indicate Bond filed a petition in Carter County District Court earlier this month seeking a protective order against Howard. An emergency order was issued Jan. 14, and a hearing was scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday. However, Sgt. Bobby Moore, Ardmore Police Department Criminal Investigations Division, said late Saturday evidence indicated Bond was willingly spending time with Howard when the shooting occurred. She was booked into the Carter County Detention Center early Saturday pending a shooting with intent to kill charge. Moore said reports would be submitted to the district attorney's office Monday for consideration of charges.

Celebratory gunfire -- something law enforcement officials have always discouraged -- consists of gun carriers shooting off random shots at midnight to celebrate the New Year. Nearly every year someone in the Muskegon area reports property damage or personal injury during that time, authorities say. This year, on Jan. 1 around 12:15 a.m. in the 300 block of Monroe Avenue in Muskegon, a woman reported that her second-story window of her home was shot out. Officers recovered a spent 9 millimeter bullet in the residence. Police said there was a \u201chigh volume\u201d of gunshots fired at midnight in that area, so it was difficult to determine the source of that bullet. No suspects were identified.

Colon sat on the porch of the residence and waited for the pizzas as Reece hid around the side with a weapon, Karr said. Colon took the pizzas when the 34-year-old deliveryman arrived that night.

Jackson on Sunday accused the man of causing more damage to his car during a recent incident, police reports say. Jackson tried to punch the co-worker in the stomach and a third employee stepped between the two men. The three wrestled around until Jackson took a step back, pulled out his gun from his front waistband and fired two shots at the 51-year-old man, according to police. The gunshots hit the man in the forearm and torso and knocked him to the ground, according to police. He then walked up to the man, stood over him and fired two shots into his leg at point-blank range, police said. Jackson turned the gun on the other co-worker, according to police. He pointed the gun at the man and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired, according to police. Jackson then demanded the man's cellphone, but the man told him that he left it in his car, according to police reports. Jackson then ran outside, got in his black 2007 Cadillac Escalade and drove away, police said. A plant manager told police at the scene that all three men worked for the company. Investigators collected three fired bullet casings, three bullets and bullet fragments from inside the building. Messages left at the businesses were not returned. Jackson's only felony conviction came in 2005, when he pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to 100 hours of community service and two years on probation.

Rick West | Staff Photographer This story has been updated to correct the age given for Decynthia Clements' son. A 34-year-old Elgin woman was shot and killed by police early Monday after a vehicle chase and hourlong negotiation with officers, Elgin police said. Decynthia S. Clements was shot along Interstate 90 between Route 25 and Beverly Road near Elgin, officials said. Clements' brother Chevelle Clements said the family is stunned by her death and has lots of questions. \"She had an outgoing spirit. She was always willing to help people,\" he said. \"If you look at her friends on Facebook, they are all saying she's not a violent person. So why is she dead?\" Decynthia Clements, 34, of Elgin was shot and killed by an Elgin police officer Monday morning along Interstate 90. - courtesy of Chevelle Clements The shooting, which resulted in the tollway being shut down for about eight hours, happened after police started chasing Clements' sport utility vehicle on Cedar Avenue about 12:34 a.m., authorities said. Officers eventually dropped the pursuit, Police Chief Jeff Swoboda said, but later came across the damaged vehicle stopped on westbound I-90. As officers attempted to talk with the woman, they noticed she had a knife, Swoboda said. Officers tried to negotiate with her for more than an hour as she periodically moved her car several feet along I-90, police spokeswoman Kristie Hilton said. Officers eventually saw that a fire had started in the vehicle and they approached the vehicle to pull the woman out, Hilton said. At some point, an officer fired his gun, Hilton said. The officer was identified as Christian Jensen, a 19-year-veteran of the department and member of the SWAT unit. He was promoted to lieutenant in January 2017 when he was assigned to the gang crimes unit. He serves as an adviser to the Police Explorer program. Jensen has been put on administrative leave while the investigation is underway, which is protocol after police discharge a firearm, Swoboda said. Jensen has received several awards, including supervisor of the year in 2014 and an \"outstanding partner\" award from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in December. Jensen is related to an employee of Paddock Publications, which owns the Daily Herald. The Daily Herald has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for any disciplinary records about Jensen. Swoboda said it's too early to determine the exact sequence of events. \"Nobody's even looked at the body camera yet,\" he said Monday. In January, the Elgin Police Department reported 95 percent of officers were equipped with body cameras. Illinois State Police spokesman Donald Orseno said the agency is investigating at the request of Elgin police and the investigation is expected to take months. Elgin police and state police declined to answer further questions, such as how many officers were on the scene when the shooting happened. They did not say why they initially began pursuing her. \"I wish to express our condolences to the family. We are all very saddened by this incident,\" Swoboda said. Decynthia Clements had a 19-year-old son and was not married, Chevelle Clements said. She grew up in Elgin in a family of eight siblings, attended Elgin High School and held several jobs, including working as a store cashier and in-home helper, he said. She had some minor run-ins with the law, including a DUI charge in 2015 in DuPage County, Court records show, \"but nothing that would explain anything like this,\" her brother said. \"That's why we are all puzzled.\" Her longtime friend Shauna Douglas said Decynthia Clements was a great aunt to Douglas' four children. She had been struggling with some health issues but she always kept a positive attitude in front of others, Douglas said. \"She was very outgoing, funny, loving. She was a very family-oriented person, especially with all of the nieces and nephews. She has a really big family from her sisters and brothers.\" Chevelle Clements said he last saw his sister four days ago when she came to visit him and his wife at their home in Elgin. Police showed up at his house at 6 a.m. Monday to inform him of the shooting. \"They said they were negotiating with her out there for an hour. Why wouldn't they call one of us to come out and help and calm her down, if that was the case?\" he said. \"Why is a 110-pound person dead when you have extensively trained officers who should be able to de-escalate this type of situation?\" The last time an Elgin police officer shot and killed someone was in 1999, Hilton said. \u2022 Daily Herald staff writers Lee Filas and Charles Keeshan contributed to this report.", "publish_date": "2018-03-12"}, {"text": "An armored truck company is offering a $50,000 for information leading to the capture, arrest and conviction of three men who held up an armored car guard leaving a Queens bank in the middle of the day Friday.
