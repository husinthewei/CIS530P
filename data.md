The data come from gun-violence.org. For every article in the db, we extracted the contents and metadata of the article using a python library called newspaper, and we also compiled a few of the db fields into a json object. Each object has the structure text, id number, title, publish date, text, address, number killed, number injured, and shooting date. 

Taking this json file, we then bifurcated the data into the features and the labels where the features have the json object structure title and publish date, and the labels have the object structure number address, killed, number injured, and shooting date.

We currently have 83 elements in our 530_test_data.json file. With the current splitting scheme, we are allocating 70% of the data to training, 9% to validation, and 21% to testing.
