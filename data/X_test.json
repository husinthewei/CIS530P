Joseph Anderson, who was home on leave for the holidays on New Year's Day, when he was shot dead outside his former in-laws' home in Marrero.\n\nDarwin \"Trent\" Bethune, 24, of 3366 Rosemont Drive in eastern New Orleans, will be tried on the charge of second-degree murder during the week of Nov. 3. A Jefferson Parish grand jury handed up an indictment last week charging him in Anderson's death.\n\nThe trial date was announced Friday, during a status hearing in 24th Judicial District Judge Robert Pitre's court. Bethune, one of numerous inmates who appeared in court, said nothing during the brief hearing. He's due back in court next month.\n\nAnderson, 31, an animal-care specialist who had served two tours in Iraq and one in Kuwait, was dropping off his three children, ages 7, 11 and 12, at their grandparents' home in the 6100 block of Ray Street, when he was shot in the face in the driveway. He died just hours before he was scheduled to return to his duty station at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.\n\nHis mother's vehicle, which he was driving, was stolen, leading authorities initially to suspect the soldier was killed during a carjacking. Deputies found it the following day, about two miles away on Rue Louis St. Phillipe in Marrero.\n\nHowever, court records show a link between the suspect and the soldier. Bethune had been romantically involved with Anderson's former wife, according to a court stay-away order in which he is identified as her \"current or former dating partner.\" Authorities have not discussed publicly the link in connection with the homicide.\n\nBethune is charged with unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, accused of going into Anderson's ex-wife's home in Harvey without permission on Jan. 5, days after Anderson was killed, court records show. In connection with his bond in that criminal case, he was barred from being within 300 feet of her, court records show.\n\nAnderson and his wife, who had accused him of abusing her and moved back to Jefferson Parish from Hawaii as a result in 2012, were divorced in September, court records show. The former couple was granted joint custody of their children in November. The children live with her, but Anderson was to get custody alternatively on major holidays, including New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, according to the custody agreement.\n\nAbout a month after Anderson was killed, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office detectives announced Bethune as their suspect. Bethune turned himself in days later.\n\nBethune would face mandatory life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. He remains jailed in lieu of a $2 million bond. Prosecutors sought the unusually high bond because they say Bethune applied for a passport so he could leave the country.\n\nHis attorneys will seek a court order in an attempt to bar prosecutors from presenting some evidence during the trial. The \"suppression hearing\" is set for Sept. 19.\n\nFriday's status hearing was housekeeping in nature. Assistant District Attorney Angel Varnado told the judge her office has three boxes of evidence to turn over to Bethune's attorneys, Martin Regan and Aiden Shah.

Instead, Parker said the release came after discussion among the mayor's office, police department and city legal department once HPD had completed its internal investigation.\n\nParker and Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland described the decision to release the video as an effort toward \"transparency.\" The video, which shows the initial interaction between Baker and the officer but not the shooting, came two days after officials refused demands by the family and local activists to release it.\n\n\"It has been the legal department's position that because there is pending litigation we shouldn't release it,\" Parker said. \"And I respect the legal department but I don't always agree with them.\"\n\nWhen asked if the release of the video should have been handled differently, Parker said it could have happened more quickly. She said the city needs a uniform policy on releasing any type of HPD-related video, especially as Houston rolls out a body-worn camera program next year for officers.\n\n\"I think it could have been sooner handled,\" Parker said. \"I just want to make sure that as videos are released in the future, it's done by policy and by schedule \u2013 not by what's on the video itself. If it's embarrassing, it's embarrassing. If it has the potential to incite people, we have to know that and we have to handle how the video is released in a way that's safe. It shouldn't be 'well there's nothing on it, we can release it' \u2014 that's not good public policy. That's not transparency. That's not what we want to have happen.\"\n\nIn a brief statement, McClelland said he allowed access to the footage \"in the interest of public trust and transparency,\" noting that it was obtained from private entities.\n\n\"During the course of the investigation, no video evidence was discovered or recovered that captured the shooting incident,\" the chief said.\n\nThe lawsuit and video release come a week after authorities in Chicago charged a police officer with first-degree murder following a judge's order to release dashcam video that contradicted the longstanding official account of a black 17-year-old's shooting death 13 months earlier.\n\nThe complaint asserts that Baker was \"shot and killed without any lawful justification\" and accuses off-duty officer Juventino Castro of considering Baker a suspect because he was a black man in a hoodie.\n\nActivists and supporters of Baker, his mother and young son assembled outside HPD headquarters on Monday to demand the release of footage they believe could show elements of the Jan. 16, 2014 shooting.\n\nOn Monday, HPD spokesman John Cannon confirmed the existence of footage from the incident, but would not reveal the source, the contents or whether the video showed Baker's death. The department also released a statement saying that because of potential litigation, \"HPD will not release any evidence regarding this case at this time as permitted by the Texas Government Code.\"\n\nThe statement also asserted that Castro's actions were \"within compliance with departmental policy and state law\" and noted that that case had been reviewed by the Independent Police Oversight Board and a Harris County grand jury, which cleared the officer of criminal wrongdoing in December 2014.\n\nProtestors on Monday demanded the release of the video, which is mentioned several times in the new lawsuit.\n\nJanet Baker, the deceased man's mother, sued on behalf of his estate. Named defendants are the City of Houston, Castro and RPI Management Co. \u2013 operator of the strip mall in northwest Houston strip mall that hired the officer to provide security.\n\nCastro told his supervisors that he stopped Jordan Baker, who was riding a bicycle in the shopping center near West Little York and Antoine, because he fit the description of people accused in recent burglaries. The officer, a 10-year veteran at that time, said Baker reacted uncooperatively when approached and ran into an alley behind the strip mall. Authorities have said the shooting happened behind the stores after Baker reached into his waistband.\n\nFearing for his life, police said, Castro fired once and struck Baker.\n\nHarris County civil rights division prosecutor Julian Ramirez said last December that there were no witnesses to the shooting beyond Castro.\n\nThe lawsuit lays out two longstanding complaints about the Houston Police Department: That black men are racially profiled as a pattern and practice of enforcement and at rates twice as high as their population as well as that HPD tolerates excessive force by failing to discipline officers who simply say they fired because they thought someone had a weapon.\n\nBaker worked part time in manufacturing. The lawsuit said he also was a college student.\n\nThe hoodie-as-suspicious-clothing allegation in recent history dates back to the fatal shooting of 17-year-old black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Florida.\n\nThe Baker filing makes numerous federal and state claims for damages, including excessive deadly force, unlawful seizure and detention, equal protection, failure to provide medical care, assault and battery, municipal liability, wrongful death and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nJanet Baker is represented by the Chicago law firm of Loevy & Loevy, which has made police misconduct one of its specialty practice areas and describes itself as winning more multi-million dollar jury verdicts in the last decade than any other civil rights firm in the country.\n\nOver the last year, supporters and activists in Houston have not allowed the memory of Jordan Baker or the circumstances of his death to fade into memory. The 26-year-old became a local emblem of the national Black Lives Matter movement. His life was honored by a candlelight vigil held in the parking lot of the shopping center and in numerous demonstrations over the last year. Janet Baker was present at the September court hearing where relatives of Robbie Tolan, the aspiring professional baseball player who survived a 2008 shooting by Bellaire police, expected jury selection in their federal lawsuit to begin but ended up agreeing to a $110,000 settlement.", "publish_date": "2015-12-02"}, {"text": "Close\n\nWake up with today\u2019s top stories\n\nGet Today\u2019s Headlines every morning and breaking news as it unfolds, right to your inbox.", "publish_date": "2014-01-13"}, {"text": "FLINT, MI -- A woman found several bullet holes and broken windows in her home after hearing gun shots just outside, according to a police report.\n\nThe woman said on Thursday, Jan. 16, around 3:30 a.m. while she was at her home in the 500 block of East Marengo Avenue she heard gunshots in front of her house.

(Photo: Andre J. Jackson, Detroit Free Press) Story Highlights Shots rang out at Al's Place Barber Shop around 6 p.m. Wednesday\n\nA man who will be questioned about the shooting was wearing body when he was arrested\n\nThe barbershop on Detroit's east side was known for gambling\n\nDETROIT -- A person of interest is in custody in connection with a shooting at an east side barbershop that left three dead and seven others injured, police announced Thursday.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig said Thursday that the man, a convicted felon, was wearing body armor when he was arrested on unrelated felony charges in suburban Rochester after the shootings Wednesday. His name wasn't immediately released.\n\nSTORY: 10 people shot at Detroit barbershop, at least 2 dead\n\nCraig said police are working with the U.S. Attorney's office to determine whether the man could be in violation of federal laws for being in possession of body armor.\n\nThe chief says someone shot a high-powered rifle through an open door into a backroom at the barbershop, where Craig says at least 20 people were \"engaged in gambling activities.\"\n\nHe said the shooting, which he called \"urban terrorism,\" might have been the result of an ongoing feud between the shooter and people at the gambling party, Craig said.\n\nCraig said that police received a 911 call at 5:47 p.m. Wednesday indicating shots had been fired. He said police were on scene by 5:49 p.m.\n\nTwo men who were struck inside the shop died on the scene, police said. The third victim, a 37-year-old man, died early Thursday at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Sgt. Mike Woody said.\n\nAs bullets came in, many of the people who were gathered inside ran for their lives, taking cover at nearby businesses, including a party store across the street.\n\nThe initial investigation, Craig said, revealed that 20 to 30 people were packed into a small room at the rear of the barbershop and were gambling.\n\nHe said a man pulled up in a vehicle and started firing at a truck with a high-powered rifle. At some point, the rear door of the shop opened and the shooter began firing inside of the business. Craig said nine people were shot inside of the location.\n\nHe said at least one person inside of the barbershop returned fire.\n\nInvestigators were searching for men driving two Chevrolet Impalas \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 involved in the shoot-out along Seven Mile Road between Mound and Ryan at about 6 p.m. Investigators said a shoot-out between the cars' occupants in an alley behind the building spilled over into the barbershop.\n\nPolice said the barbershop is known for gambling, and a dice game was taking place when the gunfire broke out. But a motive behind the shooting wasn't clear.\n\nLorne Carter, 48, was smoking a cigarette against the wall of a nearby business when he said he heard about 30 to 40 shots fired around 6 p.m. near the barbershop in the 5200 block of East Seven Mile.\n\n\"It sounded rapid,\" he said.\n\nCraig said all of the victims are male, but no ages or names were released.\n\nA distraught mother, who did not want to give her name, said she believes one of the men who was killed is her 40-year-old son. She said her three sons were in the barbershop at the time of the shooting, and one escaped and ran home to tell her and she rushed to the scene.\n\n\"I heard he's dead. \u2026 They won't let me up there,\" she said from a gas station near the scene.\n\nThat son had gone to the business to get bus money from his brother, she said. Her other two sons made it out uninjured.\n\nAt the barber shop today, the only clear visible evidence that a shooting had happened were the news vans parked nearby and strands of yellow police tale flapping in the breeze at several spots.\n\nA painted sign on the gray brick building says the shop was established in 1971. A handful of playing cards could be seen among some leaves outside the front door, and broken window glass from a vehicle lay in the alley behind the one-story shop. No one answered the door at Al's, but next door at another business, a man spoke through a glass storm door, telling a reporter that \"it's over.\"\n\nHe warned against taking pictures of the shop and closed the door.\n\nSeveral neighbors who were out walking had heard about the shooting but few said they were in the area at the time.\n\nBut Saifur Rahman, 19, was working at a fish and chicken shop across Seven Mile at the time of the shooting.\n\nHe heard a series of shots that sounded like they came from an automatic weapon.\n\nThree people \u2014all male, one older and two younger \u2014 ran into his shop and locked the outer door. Rahman was behind an interior door and they began pounding on that, telling him to let them in.\n\nHe thought he was being robbed.\n\n\"It was scary, you know, \" he said.\n\nThe three also started throwing food from various shelves onto the floor and appeared to be trying to hide. They snuck out when Rahman announced he was calling 911. He said police talked to him and took his store's surveillance tape.\n\nResidents described the neighborhood as a good one, with people attending church and participating in a block club, but all were aware of past violence at Al's.\n\n\"It's a good neighborhood, just some stuff went down,\" said one woman out walking her pit bull. She declined to give her name for fear of retaliation.\n\nShe said Al's is a popular spot, with men and women, but she said that she has stayed away.\n\n\"You don't go in shooting dice and gambling when there's no windows,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Free Press reporter Tammy Stables Battaglia; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1c1yBBT", "publish_date": "2013-11-07"}, {"text": "A shooting inside a Chatham neighborhood nightclub left one man dead and three others injured.\n\nPolice say the shooter had been involved in an argument with those men outside the club.\n\nThe shooter then walked up to the open door of the club and started shooting.\n\nFour men were rushed to the hospital.\n\nOne victim was killed, another is hospitalized in critical condition.", "publish_date": "2013-06-16"}, {"text": "PEORIA \u2014 A South Peoria man was sentenced to three years in prison Monday after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a weapon.\n\n\n\nAntonio \u201cJuke\u201d Cousins, 21, of 2101 W.

But hours after the rampage began, it was still unclear whether the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, or if other shooters were involved.\n\nThirteen people are dead and at least eight others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, officials said, spreading fear and chaos across the region as authorities sought to contain the panic.\n\nThe incident, in which the death toll rose almost hourly, represents the single worst loss of life in the District since an airliner plunged into the Potomac River in 1982, killing 78.\n\nD.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and Mayor Vincent C. Gray announced the mounting number of casualties in a series of news conferences. The suspected shooter, identified by the FBI as Aaron Alexis, 34, living in Fort Worth, is among the dead. Alexis was a military contractor, one official said.\n\nHours after the rampage began it remained unclear whether the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, or if other shooters were involved. Lanier initially said authorities were looking for two more potential shooters dressed in military style clothing. Shortly after she announced a detailed description of two suspects, city officials said one had been located and cleared. And at a 10 p.m. news conference she said police were comfortable the shooting had been committed by one person.\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information on the suspect to call 202-727-9099.\n\nLanier lifted the shelter in place order for the neighborhood around the Navy Yard that had been in place for much of the day.\n\nGray said those killed by the shooter ranged in age from 46-73 years old. He said the families of seven of the victims had been notified. Those victims were identified as: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.\n\nThe families of the six other victims were in the process of being notified.\n\nLanier said one of those killed was a District resident, but she did not identify the person.\n\nGray said another eight people were injured in the attack. He said three people were shot, including Metropolitan Police Officer Scott Williams. Gray said the officer was doing well.\n\nThe other five had either stress related injuries, and at least one was someone who fell.\n\nVice Adm. Bill French earlier had said that the number of injured was 14.\n\n[For up to the minute information about the shooting, check The Post\u2019s live blog .]\n\nGray said no motive is known yet. He said there is no reason to believe it was an act of terrorism, though he added that he could not rule it out.\n\nAs of 8:30 p.m. Monday, Navy officials said about 2,000 people remained on base, and that it could take another 3-4 hours before everyone was cleared to leave.\n\nThe FBI was still interviewing every person leaving the base out of concern that a second suspect may still be at large, French said. And SWAT teams are still finding people hiding in places on the base, where some had remained hunkered down since the initial attack early Monday morning. One city officials said that shortly before 7 p.m., officers found an employee hiding in a locker, where the employee had been for nearly 11 hours.\n\nThroughout the day, people had been warned to stay in their homes and offices on the Naval Base as the incident unfolded.\n\nAlexis was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, two law enforcement officials said. One said he also had a shotgun. One official said all the weapons have not been accounted for.\n\nThe first, sketchy details about the suspect offered few hints about what may have gone wrong.\n\n[Read our full story about Aaron Alexis.]\n\nAlexis grew up in Brooklyn with his mother, Cathleen, and father, Anthony Alexis, according to his aunt Helen Weeks.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen him for years,\u201d Weeks said of her nephew in a telephone interview. \u201cI know he was in the military. He served abroad. I think he was doing some kind of computer work.\u201d\n\nAlexis spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist from May 2007 until he was discharged in January 2011, according to a summary of his personnel records released by Navy officials at the Pentagon.\n\nThe officials said they were still researching whether Alexis had been employed as a defense contractor or a civilian employee of the Navy, and were uncertain if he was assigned to work at the Navy Yard.\n\nHe achieved his final rank of Aviation Electrician\u2019s Mate 3rd Class in December 2009. Officials said they did not immediately know the reasons for his discharge.\n\nThe carnage began around 8 a.m. when the U.S. Navy said that three shots were fired at Building 197, headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command. About 3,000 people work in the building. As the noise that some thought sounded like construction work continued, the realization set in that a gunman was firing on them.\n\nRick Mason, a program management analyst who is a civilian with the U.S. Navy, told the Associated Press that a gunman was shooting from a fourth floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the gunman was aiming at people in the building\u2019s first floor cafeteria.\n\nTerry Durham said that as she and co-workers were evacuating, she saw a man down the hall raise a rifle and fire toward them, hitting a wall.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word,\u201d said her co-worker, Todd Brundage.\n\nOne man who said he was at his desk on the second floor when the shooting began recalled hearing a loud noise \u201clike someone dropping an old metal desk.\u201d The man, who declined to give his name, said there was a pause, then several noises close together and he realized the danger: \u201cThere\u2019s a shooter in the building. I started walking toward the door and I heard people running down the hall.\u201d\n\nEmployees described the chaos, as a fire alarm sounded and people shouted, \u201cWhere is he? Where is he?\u201d\n\nGregory Dade, a Navy contractor, said he and a co-worker locked themselves in a second floor office of Building 197 as soon as the shooting went on, in fits and stops. Dade, called it \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\nHe heard a woman scream, glass crashing and a series of gun shots. Then he heard shouting: \u201cGet down! Get down! This is the police.\u201d\n\nFinally, about 11 a.m., he and a co-worker made a break for it.\n\nAt an exit, they noticed a trail of blood running to the next building.\n\nTim Jirus, a Navy commander who works in Building 197, said that as he was evacuating the building he saw a co-worker who had been shot getting into a police car, and heard more shots fired from inside his workplace.\n\nA far worse sight lay just ahead. Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe, and talked briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. It caused him to spin around to look for the source of the noise. But when he turned back, he looked down and saw the man he had been conversing with lying on the ground, shot in the head.\n\nUncertain where the shooter was, he ran.\n\n\u201cI was just lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other person was shorter than me. There were two shots, he got that guy, he didn\u2019t get me. . . . The randomness of it \u2014 standing right next to me, one person gets shot.\u201d\n\nAt least two police officers were among those shot. Lanier said the D.C. officer worked in the K-9 unit and has been on the force 23 years. She said she has known and worked closely with him for \"many, many years.\"\n\n\"He's got a stellar record,\" she said.\n\n\"He's got a pretty serious injury, but right now his family is here with him and he's in good spirits,\" Lanier added. \"He's just very grateful for all the other responders who helped get him out of that building and get the medical attention he needed.\"\n\nThe other was said to be a base officer. Earlier in the say officials at MedStar Washington Hospital Center said his chances for survival were good.\n\nJanis Orlowski, the chief medical officer at Washington Hospital Center, said three victims in all were brought to the center, all in critical condition but alert, responsive and able to talk with doctors. The victims were also able to speak briefly to law enforcement officers before undergoing surgery or treatment, she said.\n\nThe other two victims at the hospital were female civilians, Orlowski said at a news conference. All are likely to survive.\n\nThe impact of the incident rippled across town, forces schools, offices and homes into an enforced lockdown.\n\nSenate buildings on Capitol Hill went on lockdown at about 3 p.m., with no one allowed to enter or leave the building, though it was partially lifted toward the end of the day to allow staffers to go home.\n\nThe Nationals, whose ballpark is near the Navy Yard, postponed a Monday night game. Instead, they will play a double header Tuesday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nTen public and charter schools and a public school administration building in the District went on lockdown, and flights out of Reagan National Airport were briefly halted, causing delays even after they began departing again.\n\nAdm. Jonathan W.

(Published Thursday, Feb. 6, 2014)\n\nA 27-year-old Gaithersburg man has been arrested for allegedly shooting a man and then trying to run him over in Northwest D.C. last weekend.\n\nPolice say Jonathan Blades was arrested Wednesday for the shooting and hit and run that took place around 3:30 a.m. Sunday in the 1000 block of 20th Street Northwest.\n\nThe victim knew Blade's fianc\u00e9 and was talking to her after leaving a nearby club that night, News4's Prince George's County Bureau Chief Tracee Wilkins reports. Blades and the victim got into a fight, which led to the shooting.\n\nThe victim, suffering from gunshot wounds, stumbled into an Exxon gas station on M Street NW. He later told police he was shot and then run over by Blades' car.\n\nThis isn't the first time Blades has been accused of shooting someone. Prince George's County prosecutors said Blades shot and killed 19-year-old Darryl McCoy in Suitland, Md. in 2012.\n\n\"Blades, who we believe was a known drug dealer, thought that he was going to be doing a drug transaction of some sort with McCoy. Now as it turns out, McCoy is someone who likes to rob drug dealers.\u201d\n\nSince McCoy pulled his gun first, it was considered self-defense, and Blades' murder charges were dropped.\n\nBlades' story of self-defense was supported by a witness two years ago. This time, according to his D.C. arrest warrant, he shot at the victim three to five times, striking him once in the back as he ran away.\n\n\u201cIt's certainly very disappointing to us to hear that this has happened. It's just an unfortunate situation where we can only charge crimes based on the evidence that we have,\u201d the official said.\n\nBlades is now being held in a D.C. jail with charges of assault with intent to kill while armed.

Late Tuesday the Alameda County Coroner\u2019s office confirmed that he was 42-year-old Sgt. Tom Smith Jr., a 20-year law enforcement veteran.\n\n\u201cThis is a shocking thing for a BART officer to be killed in the line of duty,\u201d said elected BART Director Gail Murray, of Walnut Creek. \u201cBut like all peace officers, our BART police risk their lives when they go out to work in the stations and cities. We feel very saddened for the family, who would not expect (this to) happen to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nAround 2 p.m. Tuesday, a group of four members of BART\u2019s detective unit and several members of Dublin Police and Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s departments, converged on the Park Sierra Apartments, at 6450 Dougherty Road. Wearing bulletproof vests, the group were there to search of an apartment belonging a suspect in several robberies on BART property, authorities said.\n\nThe suspect, whom officials did not name, was already in custody and was not inside the apartment at the time, according to Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is leading the investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe officers began their search by knocking twice on the door. Each knock went unanswered, but the door was unlocked, so several of them stepped inside, Nelson said.\n\nNot knowing whether anyone was inside the apartment, the officers followed protocol and entered with their guns drawn, Nelson said.\n\nThe details of what happened next have not been released, but Nelson said that once inside the apartment, one of the officers fired a single shot from his weapon, wounding Smith, who later died at Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley.\n\nThe name of the BART officer who fired the shot was not released.

Rosalia Vazquez, who lives several doors down from where the shooting occurred inside the Park Sierra Apartments, said she wasn\u2019t home at the time. But she knew when she arrived home that something had happened because the apartment door was barricaded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet usually.

Both officers fired several times, killing Wilkins, after they said he ignored orders to drop the weapon.\n\nThe shooting was the latest challenge for the BART system and its police force. Jan. 1 marked five years since BART police officer Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, who was being detained on a platform at the Fruitvale station.\n\nMore recently, the system was shut down by failed contract negotiations that led to strikes that stranded hundreds of thousands of Bay Area commuters in July and October.

Twenty people were found to have accidentally shot themselves; seven people made the news cleaning loaded guns; six law enforcement officers were involved in gun whoopsies; five selfless patriots made their fellow citizens safer by accidentally discharging their weapons while shopping, dining or running other routine errands (and four of them were licensed concealed carriers, supposedly \"specially trained\" to avoid these things); and five more decided to share their freedom missiles with neighbors. Four others had gun accidents while fiddling with and/or showing off their guns for no particular reason, four practicing at the range accidentally shot themselves or others (in one case, someone half a mile away), two accidentally shot humans while hunting, and two more accidentally shot themselves while producing weapons for what they said was defensive use.\n\nAmong the standouts were one of our two patriots who somehow forgot their constant companions and lifelines to freedom, and left them behind. In this case, a Colorado state legislator who left his loaded pistol behind in a canvas bag, underneath the table where he'd been seated for a hearing on expanding concealed carry laws, since concealed carriers are so awesome and safe and stuff.\n\nThere were a number of stories originally picked up as accidental shootings last week, but that on further examination were called into some question. Included among them, this episode from River Hills, WI, in which a man was said to have accidentally shot himself. Later, it was reported more ambiguously as a case of a man who was cleaning a gun, and then began \u201chandling it in a careless manner,\u201d How so? \"River Hills police say Gifford placed one round in the gun, and 'made random and reckless statements about the weapon and its use.'\" This resulted in a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has ruled this death a suicide. So, how do you count that one? Intentional? Russian Roulette? Accident? I don't know, so I left it out of the count.\n\nThen there was this one from Scotch Plains, NJ, in which it was reported that a man had been accidentally shot while he and a relative were cleaning a gun. No charges were initially filed. But the next day, the cops were back, and seized nearly 100 firearms from the house, and charged the shooter with aggravated assault, pointing a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. So what does that mean? They changed their minds about the circumstances? The cleaning story was a lie? I don't know.\n\nOne more, this time from Marietta Township, WI, where Boscobel Elementary School sixth grader Briar Brown shot himself at his Crawford County home. Briar had been shot with his .22 rifle, and he died the following day. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone will ever know exactly what happened; he was alone at the time,\u201d said Crawford County Sheriff Dale McCullick. \u201cWas it self-inflicted? Was he cleaning his gun? Was he going to shoot a skunk? I\u2019ve heard all those things, but none of us will ever know what happened. It\u2019s an absolute tragedy. We all know that.\u201d The only hint at anything other than this being an accident is the question of whether it was \"self-inflicted,\" which doesn't necessarily carry the implication that it was suicide. What happened? Again, we don't know. But there are stories like these every week, and we usually have to put them aside and just be resigned to never knowing what happened.\n\nThe children of GunFAIL were somewhat fewer than usual this week. Six were accidentally shot, the youngest being just 5 months old. The others were aged 3, 6, 12, 13 and 16. The kids were vastly outnumbered by those who shot themselves, as usual. But they were also outnumbered by those accidentally injured by gunfire in bars and restaurants. As I mentioned in the title, as South Carolina clears the way for carrying weapons in the state's bars (with Georgia now considering it, as well), a total of 15 were wounded just this past week in accidental discharges in bars and restaurants in Florida and Kansas, appropriately enough in establishments known as \"Shooters\" and \"Shot Time II,\" respectively.\n\nBelow the fold, last week's list.", "publish_date": "2014-02-27"}, {"text": "Up Close Encounters at SeaQuest Fort WorthDid you know you can hang out with otters and snorkel with stingrays in DFW?

Plenty, say Second Amendment advocates.\n\nUkraine, a nation of 45 million people, has restrictive laws governing private gun ownership. The government is in possession of more than seven million guns, while three million weapons, both legal and illicit, are in the hands of private citizens, creating a staggering gulf in firepower. By comparison, in the United States, there are 310 million guns in private hands, with only 3.85 million possessed by the military and police forces.\n\nThis fuels a longstanding argument held by gun rights advocates, that the government should not have a monopoly on the country\u2019s firearms. As largely unarmed Ukrainian protestors face off against a military armed with the world\u2019s sixth-largest inventory of small arms, American supporters of the right to bear arms are decrying restrictive gun laws both here and in Ukraine\u2014and in Venezuela, where citizens are demanding better security and protected freedom of speech. Three people have been killed there in recent weeks.\n\nThese convulsions of violence against protesters have prompted gun-rights advocates to think about taking Second Amendment protections on the road.

While there appears to be a local spike in CPL holders pulling their weapons for defense, it's impossible to say for sure. (Lauren Petracca | MLive.com)\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI \u2013 It was after 2 a.m. on a January night when a musician who had played at Yester Years Lounge left the bar on South Division Avenue and began loading band equipment into his nearby vehicle. The musician was caught off-guard when a gunman approached, stole items from the vehicle and pointed a weapon at him.\n\nThen it was the robber's turn to be surprised: The musician had a concealed pistol license and a 9 mm handgun. The suspect was hit once in the torso. The injured man's \"hollering\" made it easy for responding police to locate him. The suspect was hospitalized and later charged with armed robbery.\n\nThe Jan. 19 shooting is one of a handful of recent high-profile incidents in West Michigan pitting criminals against CPL holders. In this case and that of a fatal shooting outside the New York Fried Chicken restaurant, the CPL holders who fired their weapons were not injured. And neither of those men has been charged in connection with the shootings.\n\nIn another self-defense shooting in Ionia last September, two CPL holders involved in an argument both died in an exchange of gunfire. Police say that stemmed from road rage.\n\nThe rights of CPL holders continue to be a controversial topic in Grand Rapids and its suburbs. It\u2019s a debate that stirs people\u2019s passions, and fractures into many camps.\n\nSome have questioned how frequently CPL holders actually use their weapons. While there appears to be a local spike in these gun owners pulling their weapons for defense, it\u2019s impossible to say for sure.\n\nThat\u2019s because CPL involvement isn\u2019t factored into data that is categorized by law enforcement at a local or even a statewide level.\n\nSo the only way to track the actual frequency of self-defense shootings by CPL holders would be to pore over every shooting report individually.\n\nRelated: What does it take to get a concealed pistol license? Find out how much experience is needed\n\nIn January, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said law-abiding CPL holders could deter violent crimes. He added to the contention that more guns equal less crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a statement of ignorance when you consider there\u2019s no data,\u201d said the Rev. Jerry Bishop of Lifequest Urban Outreach Center in Grand Rapids. He has been active in anti-violence efforts in the city. \u201cThat is an inconclusive statement that has created a bunch of hype to arm people.\u201d\n\nLocal law enforcement officers say while the information would be interesting to know, it would be more relevant for legislative purposes than for policing.\n\nBut Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, whose district includes Allegan and Barry counties, argues data on self-defense shootings isn\u2019t necessary to illustrate that CPL holders prevent crimes from being carried out.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s widely accepted by the majority that if you have some sort of weapon, you\u2019re able to defend yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nANECDOTES, NOT RECORDS\n\nNew York Fried Chicken was busy the October night that two friends in their 20s ordered food from the South Division Avenue take-out restaurant following a concert in downtown Grand Rapids. The two were among an estimated three dozen customers in the parking lot when 20-year-old Delorian Taylor approached and pointed a gun at the chest of one of the men, unaware he was a CPL holder.\n\nThe man fired at Taylor from where they stood between two parked cars. Six shots hit Taylor, fatally wounding him.\n\nThe CPL holder\u2019s friend, 23-year-old Domnick Floyd, was subsequently killed by a bullet fired from an unknown person across the parking as the pair drove off. Police continue to investigate Floyd\u2019s homicide, and Kent County Prosecutor Bill Forsyth has not yet issued an opinion on whether the CPL holder \u2013 who has not been identified \u2013 was justified in killing Taylor.\n\nThe law mandates which information Michigan State Police collects on CPL holders, a spokesperson for the agency said. The state\u2019s firearms unit maintains a database that creates an annual report detailing the number of CPL holders who have licenses revoked or suspended due to criminal charges and other violations.\n\nRecord keepers with the Kent, Ionia, Allegan and Ottawa County sheriff\u2019s departments said they also don\u2019t collect records on self-defense shootings. Kent County Undersheriff Jon Hess said state police set the precedent on some crime data collection.\n\nJustifiable homicides are tracked, but reports don\u2019t distinguish whether the shooter was licensed. The only way to discern whether any shooting, fatal or not, involved a CPL holder would be to scour police report narratives, Grand Rapids Police Lt. Pat Merrill said.\n\n\u201cI know the feds are not collecting anything specific for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that. Nobody does.\u201d\n\n'COMMUNITY INJUSTICE'\n\nJeff Lodholtz, an NRA-certified CPL course instructor in Montcalm County, believes citizens who lawfully carry concealed guns deter crime. He\u2019d love to be able to present his classes with hard facts to back up the claim, but the many gray areas in guns laws could make the reporting process a \u201clogistical nightmare,\u201d he said. He noted law enforcement agencies would have to follow a shooting case from start to finish, keeping tabs on possible forthcoming charges, to be sure whether a CPL holder acted in self-defense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see the numbers. I\u2019d love to see the data. I\u2019d love to see that because it interests me,\u201d Lodholtz said. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking at it strictly as a taxpayer \u2026 I don\u2019t want somebody to come to me election time and say we need more money for this. That would just make me mad.\u201d\n\nBishop questioned why agencies collect data for countless other incidents but not self-defense shootings. He called it a \u201ccommunity injustice\u201d at a time when guns often dominate the conversation on crime.\n\n\u201cThe compassion of the community should call us to say, \u2018Hey listen, let\u2019s track this data,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAngie Jackson covers public safety and breaking news for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.

(Photo: Chris Crook/Times Recorder)Buy Photo\n\nA Columbus man who pleaded guilty to two separate shootings that injured four and killed one will serve 32 years to life in prison.\n\nAnthony D. Wilson, 27, appeared in Muskingum County Common Pleas Court on Monday to be sentenced on two cases. Judge Kelly Cottrill accepted the state's recommended sentence for four counts in case one, and one count in case two.\n\nWilson pleaded guilty in November to a September 2013 shooting at Hoppy's Bar on Putnam Avenue that injured four people. After an altercation, Wilson had grabbed a semi-automatic handgun from his car and opened fire on the crowd of about 50 people, officials have said.\n\nHe was charged with four counts of assault, a second-degree felony. The state dismissed three other charges, including having weapons under disability, a third degree felony, tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony, and receiving stolen property, a fourth-degree felony, in exchange for the guilty plea.\n\nCottrill sentenced Wilson to two years in prison on each count in that case, plus an additional three years on the first two counts, which carried a firearm specification, for a total of 14 years.\n\nLess than four months after that shooting, Wilson shot Isaac Thomas, 35, at a home on Spangler Drive after an argument over a stolen gun. Thomas was left outside bleeding and later died at the hospital. Authorities indicted Wilson on May 14 for the incident, eight days before his arrest.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in November to one count of murder, an unclassified felony, for Thomas' death. The state dismissed another weapons charge in exchange for the plea.\n\nCottrill sentenced him to 15 years to life on that charge, plus an additional three years for the firearm specification, for a total of 18 years.\n\nThe sentences on all charges will be served consecutively, Cottrill ruled. Cottrill said his ruling was based on a pre-sentence investigation and the danger Wilson posed to the public.\n\n\"I apologize for what I've done,\" Wilson said in court. \"If I could take it back, I would.\"\n\nThe state had reduced Wilson's charges in exchange for his testimony at Chad M. Morrison's trial last week. but he was found not guilty of complicity to commit murder for giving the order to Wilson to shoot Thomas.\n\nWilson had testified that he shot and killed Thomas on Morrison's orders after Thomas stole Morrison's .357 caliber handgun. Morrison, however, testified that Wilson had acted on his own when he shot Thomas, perhaps out of fear of retribution for the September shooting at Hoppy's.\n\nMorrison was convicted by the jury of two counts of obstructing justice for driving Wilson from the scene and lying to police the next day. Cottrill also found him guilty of a weapons charge for illegally possession a handgun based on previous drug convictions. He was sentenced to a total of five years in prison.\n\nelagatta@gannett.com\n\n740-450-6753\n\nTwitter: @EricLagatta\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1bKtkVi", "publish_date": "2015-03-30"}, {"text": "LONG BEACH >> Two men were wounded in a possible gang-related shooting at about 4 p.m. Wednesday near 23rd Street and Lime Avenue.\n\nThe men were transported to a local hospital with injuries that appear to be non-life threatening, Long Beach police spokeswoman Nancy Pratt said.\n\nThe incident is being investigated as possibly gang-related, Pratt said.\n\nNo suspect information was available as of late Wednesday.\n\nAnyone with details on the shooting can contact the Police Department at 562-570-7330.\n\nAnonymous tips can be submitted by calling 1-800-222-TIPS (8477), texting TIPLA plus your tip to CRIMES (274637) or visiting www.lacrimestoppers.org.", "publish_date": "2014-01-22"}, {"text": "NORTHAMPTON \u2014 Surveillance video and an alert police officer have enabled investigators to identify two adult men suspected of going on a downtown BB gun shooting spree Sunday night that damaged windows in at least a dozen downtown businesses and restaurants.\n\n\n\nThe suspects, a 23-year-old from Palmer and a 22-year-old from East Longmeadow, face multiple charges of malicious damage, both under and over $250, Lt.

He was in jail at the time. Also, his attempted murder charge in an unrelated shooting was reduced to attempted first-degree assault, for which he was convicted.\n\nA Talent couple are suing two moving companies for $3,283,000 after a man who helped move their possessions later returned with an accomplice and took part in a robbery that included beating the husband.\n\nThe case is scheduled to go to trial at the end of October in Jackson County Circuit Court.\n\nThe elderly couple and their daughter Lori Ward, who has been appointed their guardian, brought the lawsuit against Lile North American Moving and Storage, which has a branch in Medford, and California-based Elite Moving Solutions.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple hired Elite Moving Solutions to truck the couple's possessions from California to their new home in Talent. Elite Moving Solutions allegedly got a referral from Lile Moving and Storage in Medford to use two local men to help unpack the truck.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Lile Moving and Storage failed to do criminal background checks on the men. It claims the Medford company habitually referred untrained, unvetted day laborers to other moving companies to help their drivers unload trucks \u2014 and expected those companies to return the favor when Lile needed help outside the area.\n\nThe resulting robbery and assault on the husband were not the result of highly unusual circumstances, as claimed by the moving companies' lawyers, but a \"natural and foreseeable result of allowing criminals into the sanctuary of the (couple's) home,\" the couple's attorney, Kelly Andersen, alleged in a court document. \"To prevent such access by such people is precisely why criminal background checks should have been done in the first place,\" Andersen said.\n\nIn July 2013, Curtis Lee Wiles, who had a past assault conviction, and Jason Ray Morgan were helping move the couple's possessions into the house when they dropped a box. Wiles estimated about $20,000 worth of jewelry fell out, according to a June 4, 2014, interview between Wiles and the Jackson County Sheriff's Office.\n\nWiles said they also talked to the husband, who said he didn't trust banks. Wiles said he believed the husband was Jewish and \"figured he would have money,\" according to a sheriff's report on the interview.\n\nThe two movers casually mentioned robbing the home, saying, \"If anyone needed to rob a place, it would be a good one,\" Wiles said, according to the sheriff's report.\n\nMorgan later told investigators that he and Wiles noticed items of value during the move and made mental notes about the property.\n\nIn a deposition Morgan gave from prison, he alleged that in November 2013, he, Wiles and a woman returned to the home with the intention of robbing the place.\n\nThe woman went to the house, said her car had broken down and asked to use the phone. When she returned to the car, she told the men she had seen children in the house. The trio decided to abort their robbery attempt, Morgan alleged in the deposition.\n\nThe need for money came to a head in February 2014 after Wiles shot a man in the hip who was inside a vehicle with a woman and a child. Lodged at the Jackson County Jail on attempted murder and other charges, Wiles wanted to raise money for his bail, according to monitored phone calls he made to Morgan and another woman that are detailed in a sheriff's report.\n\nThe three discussed an idea to have Morgan return to the house of the \"Jews in Talent\" to get money for Wiles' bail, according to the report.\n\nWith Wiles locked in jail, another man, James Lewis Turner, agreed to help Morgan rob the couple's house, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"All three men intended to split their plunder, using some of it to bail Wiles out of jail,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nOn May 3, 2014, Morgan and Turner, wearing masks and carrying at least one shotgun, entered the couple's house. The husband was savagely beaten in the head, back and torso with the barrel and butt of the shotgun. The two intruders then stuffed the husband and wife in a small water-heater closet, propping a door against the door so they couldn't escape. The thieves stole jewelry, cash, coins and a car, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe couple were trapped in the closet until they were found and let out by a sheriff's deputy, according to a sheriff's office report.\n\nThe husband told investigators the robbers had taken about $45,000 in cash stored in a cardboard box, plus silver coins and bullion worth $25,000 to $35,000. About $1,500 to $2,000 worth of jewelry was missing. He said the robbers had put the items in a black suitcase they found in the house, the report said.\n\nIn June 2014, Wiles was convicted of a lesser charge of attempted first-degree assault, unlawful use of a weapon and delivery of methamphetamine for the incident in which he shot the man in the hip, according to court records.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, Morgan and Turner pleaded guilty in the robbery case and were each sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison. They were also ordered to pay restitution, court records show.\n\nMoving company safety\n\nIn the lawsuit on behalf of the couple, Andersen said Lile North American Moving and Storage is misleading customers by claiming to use certified movers.\n\n\"I don't think the public has any idea when they engage a professional moving company that they're not getting what's represented on the website and in the ads,\" Andersen said in a phone interview. \"If the truck is from outside the area, the people doing the unloading are often minimally skilled day laborers who don't go through any criminal background check.\"\n\nThe Medford branch's website continues to say it uses American Moving and Storage Association certified moving consultants, and courteous, professionally trained crews to ensure a safe, easy and stress-free move.\n\nThe Medford company did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nIn a deposition, a representative from Elite Moving Systems said it's common for moving companies to contact other moving companies in an area to get recommendations for temporary, trained, experienced helpers to unload trucks. The representative said Elite trusted Lile because it was on an American Moving and Storage Association roster.\n\nHe said Lile has \"a reliable source to help with these moves. This is what all moving companies in the country do. Obviously you can't put a crew of seven or eight people in a truck. And most drivers travel alone, so we all need help unloading, and this is what they do.\"\n\nRalph Spooner, attorney for Elite Moving Systems, declined to comment due to the pending litigation.\n\nBen Veralrud, an attorney for Lile North American Moving and Storage, disputed that Lile ever referred Wiles and Morgan to help unload the Talent couple's possessions. Regardless, he said a moving company should not be blamed for a robbery, especially one that occurs months later as part of an alleged scheme to raise bail money.\n\nVeralrud said it wouldn't be fair to hold the moving company liable.\n\n\"The unfortunate, tragic home invasion by these two criminals was not linked in any way to an act by Lile,\" Veralrud said. \"It was the result of independent criminal conduct by these two individuals.\"\n\n\u2014 Reach staff reporter Vickie Aldous at 541-776-4486 or .

(Photo: Screengrab from KPNX-TV, Phoenix, video) Story Highlights Youngest victim, Shannon Moore, 17, was autistic\n\nGunman's ex-wife said he grappled with extreme depression and increasing isolation\n\nEx-wife says depression grew worse with age; anyone who set him off was a potential victim\n\nPHOENIX -- Michael Guzzo's life ended as his former wife predicted \u2014 at his own hand \u2014 but Janet Guzzo said she never envisioned her ex-husband killing anyone else as he sought to end his own deep depression.\n\nGuzzo shot a family of four, including an autistic 17-year-old boy, before killing himself with a shotgun in his Phoenix apartment on Saturday morning, according to police.\n\nSTORY: Still no answers in Phoenix quadruple homicide\n\nOn any other Monday, 66-year-old Bruce Moore, would have escorted Shannon Moore, 17, to the bus, neighbors said, so Shannon could attend classes at a Phoenix high school dedicated to meeting the needs of special-education students in a small-school environment.\n\nInstead, grief counselors met with students at the school, and many of the conversations centered around one theme: Why Shannon?\n\n\"He was such a nice kid. How could this happen to him? Why him?\" said Craig Pletenik, a Phoenix Union High School District spokesman who related the questions that the counselors received. \"He was at home. Are any of us safe? If you are not safe in your home, where are you safe?\"\n\n\u201cHe always was just such a troubled individual. You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' \u201d Janet Guzzo, Michael Guzzo's ex-wife\n\nPolice said many of the answers to the questions Shannon's classmates were grappling with probably died with Guzzo on Saturday.\n\nGuzzo used a pump-action shotgun to murder Bruce and Shannon Moore, along with Shannon's parents, Michael and Renee, and two of the family's five dogs, in a townhome the family had owned for decades, according to police. Neighbors said Guzzo often argued with pet owners about barking dogs in the development, and police said Guzzo shot at another dog-owning neighbor on Saturday before returning to his own unit and killing himself.\n\nJanet Guzzo, who was married to Guzzo for more than a decade before they divorced in 1999, said the barking dogs and the presence of a weapon, coupled with Guzzo's extreme depression and increasing isolation, could have all contributed to Saturday's murders.\n\n\"He always was just such a troubled individual,\" said Janet, a psychiatric nurse. \"You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' \"\n\nThere were few new details Monday about the family Guzzo murdered, aside from school officials' comments and information available through court records.\n\nA relative of the Moores' declined to comment Monday when reached at her home.\n\nA neighbor who has lived in the complex for more than 40 years said Bruce Moore moved to the unit to care for a relative and that his daughter and her family had joined him within the last few years.\n\nShannon was a student at Phoenix's Central High School before he transferred to Desiderata in April, Pletenik said. Word about Shannon's death had spread quickly through the tiny school Monday, Pletenik said, where about 40 students had met with counselors.\n\n\"Something like this impacts them a lot because of the size of the school,\" Pletenik said.\n\nMichael worked at a pharmacy during the early 2000s when he also was attending college and pursuing a degree in criminal justice, according to court records.\n\nRenee and Michael were married in March 1996, divorced in 2004 and were re-married in January 2006, according to court documents.\n\nCourt filings list Michael's employer as the U.S. Army, but government officials were unable to confirm any details related to his service.\n\nNeighbors said that Renee and Michael had recently returned from China and that Renee was excited to get her five dogs out of quarantine. Charise Hatchett, who lived nearby, said Renee left a note on Friday asking Hatchett to drop off her dog for a grooming appointment.\n\nThe Arizona Humane Society took possession of the three dogs that survived the shooting.\n\n\"It's just so tragic,\" Hatchett said.\n\nJanet said her ex-husband had never complained to her about his neighbors, but said his deep-seated depression, which grew worse with age, made anyone who set him off a potential victim.\n\n\"It was a case of mental illness, and (he) chose not to address it,\" she said.\n\n\"Sadness, isolation.

He pulled the trigger, but she said she deflected the shotgun\u2019s barrel and suffered only powder burns to her shoulder. After that, he hit her with the gun\u2019s barrel, loaded it and shot himself.\n\nShe fled at that point and thought she was wounded when she reached the home of a neighbor a quarter-mile away. The neighbor called 911 and Domasinsky drove to the neighbor\u2019s home, but the homeowner armed himself and asked Domasinsky to leave.\n\nWhen police arrived, they found Domasinsky sitting in his truck at his home, conscious. He was taken to Maine Medical Center in Portland by a LifeFlight helicopter. Domasinsky\u2019s aggravated assault charge is a class B felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nMaloney said the GPS device was put on his right ankle. On Friday evening, she said she knew where Domasinsky was.\n\n\u201cHe is at home right now, and the bracelet is reporting properly,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme\n\nShare", "publish_date": "2014-10-10"}, {"text": "Woman found dead in vacant home in south Houston\n\nHouston Police Department investigate body of woman found in abandoned house at 2916 Rosalie, Jan. 23, 2014, in Houston, Tx.
