Sharp, 25, whose body was found Jan. 31 in the yard of a home in the 2700 block of South Whittier Avenue, the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office announced Friday.\n\nKorodney M. Jones, 22, of the 2800 block of Poplar Ave., and Demetriana R. Ross, 20, of the 1500 block of South Seventh Street, were arrested Thursday night.\n\nFloyd Williams, 24, also of Springfield, has been in the Sangamon County Jail since late June on charges of manufacturing with the intent to deliver marijuana and criminal damage to property.\n\nEach was charged with first-degree murder, armed robbery and home invasion, the sheriff's office said. A grand jury indicted all three last week.\n\nBond was set at $1 million for Jones and Ross and at $2 million for Williams. All three are scheduled to appear in court at 2:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nSangamon County Sheriff Neil Williamson said he couldn't say why Williams' bond was set higher than the other two. People can still be charged with first-degree murder even if they did not pull the trigger.\n\nWilliamson said the killing was drug-related and robbery was a motive. He described the three people who were arrested and Sharp as local, small-time drug dealers.\n\nThe sheriff's office was familiar with all four people involved, he said. Nobody else is being sought in connection with the crime.\n\n\u201cWe had suspects from the start, but it was very difficult to place individuals there and know who exactly did what,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThrough our investigation, and with the help of informants and tips, the case became clearer, and we were able to take it to the grand jury last week.\u201d\n\nA passerby noticed Sharp's body lying in a yard at 7:20 a.m. Jan. 31 along the side of a home at the corner of Whittier and Highland avenues, just outside of Springfield city limits.\n\nThe Sangamon County coroner's office said Sharp died from a single gunshot wound.\n\nSharp was arrested in August 2013 and was facing felony drug charges. He was out of jail after posting $2,000 bail.\n\nJones was on parole stemming from a 2012 robbery conviction in Madison County, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections website.
