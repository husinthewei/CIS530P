Violent crime is surging.\n\nLast September, 13-year-old Matthew McGee was shot and killed outside a Castleton-area restaurant after an apparent dispute between groups of kids.\n\nIn October 2015, 17-year-old Coriana Johnson and her 18-year-old friend were gunned down inside a car on the west side.\n\nAnd just one month earlier, another drive-by shooting ended in the killing of another child: Deshaun Swanson, 10 years old, hit by a stray bullet while attending a memorial service with his mother.\n\nOf the 25 children killed by gun violence in Indianapolis since 2014, 22 have been black.\n\nBuy Photo IMPD Chief Bryan Roach explains how investigators believe a feud on social media led to the gunfire. (Photo: Michelle Pemberton/IndyStar)\n\nIMPD, led by Chief Bryan Roach since 2017, has placed a renewed focus on homicide investigations. Five detectives have joined the homicide unit. Outside experts are consulting the department on improving investigations. The city has created a witness assistance fund to protect those who fear retaliation after helping police with crucial tips.\n\nIMPD also has joined other police and prosecutors \u2014 both local and federal \u2014 in a unified strategy to reduce gun violence. By targeting criminals who illegally carry weapons, law enforcement leaders hope to see a decline in homicides and non-fatal shootings.\n\nEach of IMPD's six districts now contains investigators focused on the strategy: federal prosecutors, IMPD detectives, federal agents and task force officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nWhether the strategy will lead to the slowing of violence remains to be seen. Implementation began late last year and will need time to take shape.\n\nBoarded up with plywood and pockmarked with bullet holes, the small white house on Wittfield Street served as a meeting place for Ten Point volunteers, IMPD officers and the little girl's family.\n\nRobin Robson sobbed in the yard where just hours before police collected evidence.\n\n\"The violence needs to stop,\" she pleaded.\n\nThe Rev. Charles Harrison of the Ten Point Coalition implored the community to come together and act.\n\n\"We have to care,\" Harrison said. \"...We're not gonna accept our babies killing each other.\"\n\nAnyone with information about the incident should call the IMPD homicide office at (317) 327-3475 or Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317) 262-8477.

Additionally, investigators located a bag containing a green, leafy substance believed to be THC. These substances were tested, and tested positive for cocaine (7.4 grams) and THC (4.6 grams).\n\nAccording to investigators, Golden indicated around 1 a.m., he and another individual went to the pub, and the other individual went inside while he waited outside. He said a large group exited the bar, and \"several members turned their attention toward him.\" He said he walked toward his vehicle parked on St. Patrick St. and retrieved his Glock .40 caliber from the vehicle.

But the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under the new legislation \u2014 which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward\u2019s Chief Judge Jack Tuter.\n\nThe man is also prohibited from trying to purchase or obtain guns or ammunition from any source.\n\nThe legislation is part of a bill signed one week ago by Gov. Rick Scott. The new laws impose some restrictions on gun sales and give law enforcement new power to take action when they have evidence that a person may pose a danger. The National Rifle Association immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court in Tallahassee challenging some aspects of the law, including the legality of banning gun sales to people under the age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe put the safety of our residents first,\u201d said Lighthouse Point Mayor Glenn Troast. \u201cThis is not about the Second Amendment and it\u2019s not about the NRA.

Troast said he grew up in a law enforcement family, hunted with guns and has a healthy respect for firearms and gun rights.\n\nLighthouse Point police made the request on March 14, one week after they were called to conduct a welfare check on the man, who they said was behaving strangely at his condominium building. Authorities said it was the latest in a series of encounters law enforcement had with the man, though he has no prior history of arrests in Florida. He had some prior arrests in Pennsylvania, records show.\n\nPolice were called after the man turned off the main electrical breakers to the condo building in Lighthouse Point, court records show. The South Florida Sun Sentinel is not identifying the man because of his medical condition.\n\nThe man told officers he \u201cwas being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in [his] building,\u201d the judge wrote in his order. \u201c[He] could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor [can] \u2018shape shift, he can change heights and I\u2019m not sure where he comes from\u2019 and \u2018to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also told officers that he had to turn off the electrical breakers because \u201cthey are electrocuting me through my legs.\u201d\n\nOfficers said they saw weapons in his home after they were called to check on his welfare. They also found evidence he had \u201ca voluminous amount of notes containing numerous references to former President Barack Obama, that he was killed in the 1980s but came back and now murders children to place their spirits into [the man\u2019s] head, is a member of [al-Qaida], and is [the man\u2019s] enemy,\u201d the judge wrote in his order.\n\nThe man was involuntarily committed for treatment in a separate proceeding and it is not yet known when he would be eligible for release, records show. The man did not attend the initial hearing, which temporarily removes his access to guns, because he is hospitalized.\n\nThe guns that were temporarily seized were a Ruger LCP .380 pistol, an M2 Mauser .45 pistol, a Charter Arms .357 mag snub nose revolver and a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun, according to the court order. Authorities have also begun the process of notifying federal and state authorities, as required by the law, so that the issue would be flagged if the man attempts to purchase a gun.\n\nLighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata said officers have had interactions with the man over a number of years but none of them had risen to the level that would have warranted removing the man\u2019s access to guns. There was also no legal method to do so in the past.\n\n\u201cI think this is what the general public has been looking for \u2014 for law enforcement to be able to intervene in these kinds of situations \u2014 for a long time,\u201d the chief said.\n\nHe said he wished he had such legislation a couple of years ago when another city resident was involuntarily committed for psychiatric help after a domestic incident and police took his guns for safekeeping. A very short time after the man was released from hospital, he demanded the return of his firearms. Police were still concerned for his well-being and the safety of others. Officers eventually agreed to release the guns to a family member, Licata said.\n\nLicata said he anticipates other communities around the state will soon file their own requests as issues arise in their own communities.\n\n\u201cThis may be the first but it\u2019s certainly not going to be the last,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the requirements of the state law, Lighthouse Point police, Cirullo and the man whose guns were removed are due in court on March 28 for a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year.", "publish_date": "2018-03-16"}, {"text": "Police gather at the crime scene after one man was shot to death and a second was wounded late Tuesday afternoon in West Philadelphia.

Jackson, Detroit Free Press) Story Highlights Shots rang out at Al's Place Barber Shop around 6 p.m. Wednesday\n\nA man who will be questioned about the shooting was wearing body when he was arrested\n\nThe barbershop on Detroit's east side was known for gambling\n\nDETROIT -- A person of interest is in custody in connection with a shooting at an east side barbershop that left three dead and seven others injured, police announced Thursday.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig said Thursday that the man, a convicted felon, was wearing body armor when he was arrested on unrelated felony charges in suburban Rochester after the shootings Wednesday. His name wasn't immediately released.\n\nSTORY: 10 people shot at Detroit barbershop, at least 2 dead\n\nCraig said police are working with the U.S. Attorney's office to determine whether the man could be in violation of federal laws for being in possession of body armor.\n\nThe chief says someone shot a high-powered rifle through an open door into a backroom at the barbershop, where Craig says at least 20 people were \"engaged in gambling activities.\"\n\nHe said the shooting, which he called \"urban terrorism,\" might have been the result of an ongoing feud between the shooter and people at the gambling party, Craig said.\n\nCraig said that police received a 911 call at 5:47 p.m. Wednesday indicating shots had been fired. He said police were on scene by 5:49 p.m.\n\nTwo men who were struck inside the shop died on the scene, police said. The third victim, a 37-year-old man, died early Thursday at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Sgt. Mike Woody said.\n\nAs bullets came in, many of the people who were gathered inside ran for their lives, taking cover at nearby businesses, including a party store across the street.\n\nThe initial investigation, Craig said, revealed that 20 to 30 people were packed into a small room at the rear of the barbershop and were gambling.\n\nHe said a man pulled up in a vehicle and started firing at a truck with a high-powered rifle. At some point, the rear door of the shop opened and the shooter began firing inside of the business. Craig said nine people were shot inside of the location.\n\nHe said at least one person inside of the barbershop returned fire.\n\nInvestigators were searching for men driving two Chevrolet Impalas \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 involved in the shoot-out along Seven Mile Road between Mound and Ryan at about 6 p.m. Investigators said a shoot-out between the cars' occupants in an alley behind the building spilled over into the barbershop.\n\nPolice said the barbershop is known for gambling, and a dice game was taking place when the gunfire broke out. But a motive behind the shooting wasn't clear.\n\nLorne Carter, 48, was smoking a cigarette against the wall of a nearby business when he said he heard about 30 to 40 shots fired around 6 p.m. near the barbershop in the 5200 block of East Seven Mile.\n\n\"It sounded rapid,\" he said.\n\nCraig said all of the victims are male, but no ages or names were released.\n\nA distraught mother, who did not want to give her name, said she believes one of the men who was killed is her 40-year-old son. She said her three sons were in the barbershop at the time of the shooting, and one escaped and ran home to tell her and she rushed to the scene.\n\n\"I heard he's dead. \u2026 They won't let me up there,\" she said from a gas station near the scene.\n\nThat son had gone to the business to get bus money from his brother, she said. Her other two sons made it out uninjured.\n\nAt the barber shop today, the only clear visible evidence that a shooting had happened were the news vans parked nearby and strands of yellow police tale flapping in the breeze at several spots.\n\nA painted sign on the gray brick building says the shop was established in 1971. A handful of playing cards could be seen among some leaves outside the front door, and broken window glass from a vehicle lay in the alley behind the one-story shop. No one answered the door at Al's, but next door at another business, a man spoke through a glass storm door, telling a reporter that \"it's over.\"\n\nHe warned against taking pictures of the shop and closed the door.\n\nSeveral neighbors who were out walking had heard about the shooting but few said they were in the area at the time.\n\nBut Saifur Rahman, 19, was working at a fish and chicken shop across Seven Mile at the time of the shooting.\n\nHe heard a series of shots that sounded like they came from an automatic weapon.\n\nThree people \u2014all male, one older and two younger \u2014 ran into his shop and locked the outer door. Rahman was behind an interior door and they began pounding on that, telling him to let them in.\n\nHe thought he was being robbed.\n\n\"It was scary, you know, \" he said.\n\nThe three also started throwing food from various shelves onto the floor and appeared to be trying to hide. They snuck out when Rahman announced he was calling 911. He said police talked to him and took his store's surveillance tape.\n\nResidents described the neighborhood as a good one, with people attending church and participating in a block club, but all were aware of past violence at Al's.\n\n\"It's a good neighborhood, just some stuff went down,\" said one woman out walking her pit bull. She declined to give her name for fear of retaliation.\n\nShe said Al's is a popular spot, with men and women, but she said that she has stayed away.\n\n\"You don't go in shooting dice and gambling when there's no windows,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Free Press reporter Tammy Stables Battaglia; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1c1yBBT", "publish_date": "2013-11-07"}, {"text": "Suspect has not been identified\n\nA police officer in Eustis shot and killed a suspect Tuesday afternoon in Leesburg.The shooting happened at Laurel Oaks Apartment complex off Sleepy Hollow Road.Detectives said the Eustis officer fired multiple shots and that one person was killed.

Fernandez also pleaded no contest last week to the charge of driving on a suspended license.\n\nOn April 20th, 2014, when Lee County deputies stopped Fernandez for an alleged traffic violation in Fort Myers Beach, they detected the scent of marijuana wafting out of his car. Then, when a deputy instructed Fernandez to step out of his vehicle, a loaded handgun fell of his pocket. Deputies searched Fernandez and found the marijuana and Alprazolam, the drug commonly known as Xanax, in his shorts.\n\nFernandez testified on Friday in his own defense. On the stand, he admitted to possessing the marijuana and prescription pills, but he denied that there was ever a weapon in his shorts. He argued that the arresting deputy, who found the handgun at Fernandez's feet, was incorrect in assuming that the handgun must have come from Fernandez.\n\nAfter two and a half days of trial, the six-member jury deliberated for about an hour. Fernandez was remanded into custody until his sentencing date in September. He faces up to 15 years in prison. Fernandez's attorney, James Stanton, declined to give his reaction to Tuesday's guilty verdict.\n\n\"I'm going to reserve any and all comments until after the sentencing,\" Stanton said.\n\nProsecutor Brenda Wade also declined to comment.\n\nChristopher Corey (Photo: Submitted)\n\nIt remains uncertain if Fernandez will face charges in the Collier County killing. Fernandez has long been a named suspect in the killing of former Marine Christopher Corey in the Naples Manor section of East Naples, but Fernandez has never been charged. On January 20, 2014, Corey was at his home on Holland Street when two men burst inside around 3 a.m. and shot Corey and his two dogs.\n\nMichelle Batten, a spokesperson in the Collier County Sheriff's Office, would say only that, \"I believe it's still an active investigation.\"\n\nFernandez's attorney said he was not aware of the Collier County case.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the News Alerts newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Get alerted to the latest stories to stay on top of the news.

Morris had been charged with first degree murder, but his trial ended in a hung jury, and prosecutors offered him the manslaughter plea in order to avoid a re-trial that would have been emotionally difficult for Corey's family. Morris is now serving a 17-year prison sentence.\n\nA co-conspirator in the killing, Mallory McCann, was inside Corey\u2019s residence when the two men broke into the house. She had sent text messages to Fernandez at 3 a.m. to let him know the home\u2019s front door was unlocked, according to evidence at Morris' trial. McCann is now serving a 15-year prison sentence after a January plea agreement on robbery with a firearm.\n\nMcCann testified at Morris' trial, saying that Morris and Fernandez planned to steal drugs and money from Corey. McCann testified that she heard Morris and Fernandez discussing later how Fernandez had carried out the shooting.\n\nIn February 2014, Fernandez told a Naples Daily News reporter via Facebook that was not involved in the killing.\n\n\"Of the mistakes I have made, I had nothing to do with the murder of a Marine and his dog,\" wrote Fernandez.\n\nAt least one Collier County detective sat in the courtroom to observe Fernandez's weapons trial.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://nplsne.ws/2azKxRN", "publish_date": "2016-08-02"}, {"text": "Police: Man injured in overnight shooting in Norfolk Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

He is not in police custody and a warrant was issued Thursday for his arrest.\n\nThe U.S Marshals are searching for Bradley. He is considered armed and dangerous. He is known to frequent East Cleveland, near Euclid and Superior avenues, according to the U.S. Marshals.\n\nAnother man, Calvin Young, 24, is also charged in the case. He faces charges of gross abuse of a corpse, obstructing official business and tampering with evidence.\n\nBradley is accused of killing Miriam Johnson, the mother of three of her four children, all between 13 and 7 years old, family members said. Cleveland Heights Police Chief Annette Mecklenburg said investigators believe Bradley killed Johnson at her apartment in Cleveland Heights and that Young helped Bradley move her body to the abandoned home in Cleveland.\n\nCalvin Young\n\nJohnson's family last saw her on Feb. 25, when her mother dropped her off at her Mayfield Road apartment. The next day she called off work at the Map Room restaurant in downtown Cleveland, according to police reports.\n\nHer family reported her missing March 6. Johnson's mother told Cleveland Heights police that her daughter had recently received her income tax check and that Bradley often would \"come around\" when her daughter had money, according to a police report.\n\nCleveland Heights police said they feared Bradley had been holding her against her will and that Johnson was in danger. Bradley has three times been convicted of violently attacking Johnson.\n\nPolice kept searching for Johnson. Her body was found stuffed in a garbage can on March 25 at an abandoned home on Chamberlain Avenue, between East 71st and East 74th streets in Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood.\n\nShe died of a gunshot wound to the head and stab wounds to her torso, arms and legs, according to the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner.\n\nJohnson has been the victim of violence at the hands of Bradley at least three times since 2010, according to court records.\n\nIn 2012, he broke into her Cleveland home after learning that Johnson gave money to a new boyfriend.\n\nHe pushed her into the house and slapped her in the face and back of the head. He locked his crying children in a room, then repeatedly punched Johnson in the face until he knocked her unconscious. Johnson woke up to Bradley urinating on her. Bradley then kicked her several more times in the side while she was curled up on the floor. Johnson got away, ran to a neighbor's house and called 911.\n\nBradley was sentenced to 18 months in prison in that case.\n\nHe twice attacked her in 2010 and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. On March 22, 2010 he argued with Johnson, shoved her onto her bed and choked her until she nearly passed out. Johnson got free from his grip and ran into the hall, where Bradley shoved her. He blocked her from being able to leave the home. Johnson suffered injuries to her neck and collar bone in the attack.\n\nTwo months later, he grabbed Johnson and dragged her into her home and attacked her.\n\nBradley in 2016 pleaded guilty to drug possession and was sentenced to two years on probation. Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority police arrested him with drugs, a digital scale and bullets. He violated the terms of his probation and a warrant was issued for his arrest in November.\n\nHe was also convicted of drug trafficking and theft in 2004.\n\nYoung is also on probation stemming from an October conviction for child endangering and criminal damaging. He was sentenced to two years on probation in that case.\n\nHe is also facing charges of possessing a weapon under disability and improperly handling a gun in a car stemming from a Jan. 28 arrest.

The man also is being investigated for first-degree assault in Island County.\n\nOttersen is accused of shooting two acquaintances on Camano Island and then leading police on a high-speed chase into Mukilteo.\n\nOf the two people who were shot on the island, one, a 44-year-old man, remains at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. The other, a woman, was treated and released for a gunshot wound.\n\nThe victims were sitting in a car in the 500 block of Michelle Drive at about 3:15 p.m. when Ottersen reportedly approached the driver\u2019s side window and asked for cigarettes.\n\nOne of them handed Ottersen a pack of cigarettes. Ottersen grabbed the pack and then \u201cpulled out a firearm and without warning or provocation shot (the male victim) in the head,\u201d detectives were told.\n\nThe bullet went into the left side of the man\u2019s face and out the right side of his neck, according to court papers. The same bullet went through the woman\u2019s arm.\n\nThe victims\u2019 injuries were consistent with their statements, detectives wrote in a search warrant affidavit.\n\nThe gunman then drove off in a 2001 Toyota Camry.\n\nTwo Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies spotted the car a few miles away on Highway 532 near Stanwood. They attempted to pull Ottersen over but he took off eastbound, reaching speeds of 100 mph.\n\nThe chase continued onto southbound I-5 at similar speeds. Ottersen reportedly was weaving through lanes and using the shoulder to pass.\n\nA Washington State Patrol trooper joined in the pursuit on I-5. An Everett police officer also joined as the chase wound westbound onto Highway 526 toward Mukilteo.\n\nDuring the chase, Ottersent reportedly called 911 and told the dispatcher he had shot someone in Stanwood. He said he was in a pursuit and he \u201cwould not stop,\u201d according to the warrant.\n\nHe then drove into Mukilteo.\n\nAt the intersection of 92nd Street SW and 53rd Avenue West, a deputy tried to ram the Camry to cause Ottersen to lose control, an effort known as a \u201cPIT maneuver.\u201d The PIT maneuver wasn\u2019t successful, and Ottersen continued northbound on 53rd Avenue West.\n\nWhile turning westbound on 88th Street SW, Ottersen lost control and the Camry went into a ditch. That was at about 3:50 p.m.\n\nPolice caught up a few seconds later.\n\nThree neighbors heard the commotion and looked outside.\n\nThe three reportedly told investigators that they saw Ottersen get out of his car and wait for officers to arrive. At first, Ottersen appeared to follow the officers\u2019 commands and put his hands up. Then he suddenly grabbed a handgun from his waist.\n\nAll three witnesses said Ottersen pointed the gun at police, according to the warrant.\n\nThe search warrant provides additional detail from the confusing conclusion of the chase. Shortly after the suspect\u2019s car was rammed, police-radio traffic captured officers reporting that shots were fired. Then the officers reported the suspect was at gunpoint. Seconds later, police again reported shots fired. They said the suspect was down and in need of medical aid.\n\nInvestigators have not yet said whether Ottersen fired his weapon at the officers.\n\nAs of Friday, he remained at Harborview. He is expected to face charges in Snohomish and Island counties.\n\nThe Mukilteo shooting is being investigated by the Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team. The team includes detectives from around the county who probe cases where police use potentially fatal force.\n\nThe SMART team sought a judge\u2019s permission to search the Toyota Camry for potential evidence.

Cretella said Tuesday morning\u2019s testimony by New Haven Police Detective Marcin Podsiad identifying Bennett as the man in the white pompom hat opening fire in the club\u2019s surveillance videotape \u201cput it over the top.\u201d\n\nBut Cretella said Bennett also decided to plead guilty because \u201che didn\u2019t want the (Robinson\u2019s) family to have to watch the video again. The video showed their daughter\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing in which Bennett pleaded guilty, Robinson\u2019s father, Gregory Fulcher, said he is still angry at Bennett. Looking straight at Bennett, Fulcher added, \u201cBut I thank you for not putting us through any more agony.\u201d\n\nBennett pleaded guilty to the most serious charge of murder and to five of the 10 assault counts. He originally also was charged with first-degree manslaughter with a firearm and two weapons counts. The original assault charges carried two counts for each of the five wounded victims: one each for first-degree assault/discharging a firearm and first-degree assault/extreme indifference to life. The \u201cextreme indifference to life\u201d assault counts were dropped, along with the manslaughter and weapons charges, in the agreement Cretella worked out with Senior Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Michael Pepper and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Lisa D\u2019Angelo.\n\nBut Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Clifford told Bennett he still faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 193\u00bd years when he returns to court Feb. 4, 2016. That\u2019s because Bennett could get up to 60 years for murder, up to 20 years for each of the assault counts and was exposed to 33\u00bd years for violating probation connected to a previous conviction.\n\nOne month before the club shootings, he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell, for which he received a five-year prison sentence, and he then violated probation by committing the crimes at the club. At that point he had not begun serving the five-year sentence.\n\nClifford told Bennett, who was stoic as he acknowledged all this information, that he must serve a minimum of 25 years. Bennett apparently believes he still will receive a lesser sentence than if he had continued with the trial and been convicted.\n\nThe trial had opened Monday with jurors repeatedly viewing surveillance videotape showing the shooting at the club on St. John Street at 3:30 a.m. Oct. 26, 2013. Some members of Robinson\u2019s family were so upset by the tape that they quickly left the courtroom.\n\nBennett, now 30, of Howard Avenue, had shown no emotion as he watched the videotape.\n\nThe other victims were Jahad Brumsey, Nijia Ward, Albert Dickerson, Amanda John and Ivette Sterling. They ranged in age from 19 to 34. Robinson, who lived in West Haven, was 26.\n\nAccording to the police warrant, a source quoted Bennett as saying he intended just to shoot Brumsey and nobody else. Brumsey, shot repeatedly in his abdomen, probably was the most seriously injured after Robinson. She was shot once and pronounced dead shortly after she arrived at Yale-New Haven Hospital.\n\nTuesday morning\u2019s testimony was provided by Podsiad, a plainclothes detective who said he knows Bennett as someone in the Newhallville neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve been in his presence on more than one occasion.\u201d\n\nWhile Pepper screened a videotape of patrons being checked by security guards at the Lazy Lizard on Crown Street in the hours before the Key Club shooting, Podsiad identified Bennett as one of the men leaving and entering. That club closed at 2 a.m.\n\nPepper then showed a videotape of a man Podsiad identified as Bennett entering the Key Club. He said Bennett was the figure wearing a white pompom hat.\n\nOther surveillance cameras showed that man\u2019s appearances in other rooms of the club in the ensuing minutes. But before Pepper reached the point of the shooting, during which Podsiad was expected to identify Bennett as the gunman, Superior Court Judge Brian T. Fischer suspended testimony for the mid-morning recess.\n\nThe jury never heard another moment of testimony. During the recess, Cretella approached the two prosecutors to inform them Bennett wanted to plead guilty to some of the charges. Fischer then dismissed the jury and everybody else went upstairs to Clifford\u2019s courtroom for the plea hearing.\n\nWhen Bennett entered that courtroom, he was still wearing a red tie and dark suit but handcuffs had been put on him.\n\nBennett quietly answered \u201cguilty\u201d to the murder charge and five assault counts.\n\nClifford told Bennett that when he imposes the sentence, its length \u201cwill be up to me, after listening to the attorneys and other people\u2019s comments.\u201d This will include the relatives of the victims.\n\nWhen Clifford asked whether any family members wanted to speak right away in addition to on the sentencing date, Gregory Fulcher approached the podium. After thanking Clifford and the prosecution team, Fulcher also thanked \u201cthe Lord Jesus, that helped us through this from day one.\u201d\n\nFulcher said he remains angry at Bennett because \u201che took a great piece of us.\u201d But he thanked him for pleading guilty and told him that in prison \u201cyou\u2019ll have to get yourself together through Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nAfter court adjourned and Bennett was taken back to lock-up, Robinson\u2019s mother, Celeste Fulcher, said she, too, was thankful Bennett had admitted his guilt. \u201cThat video, it was horrifying.\u201d\n\nGregory Fulcher then said, \u201cThere is no justice; it\u2019s just us, standing, with anguish for the rest of our lives.\u201d\n\nHe praised Bennett because he came forward \u201cto man up and say: \u2018Enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nFulcher remarked Bennett will not be able to apologize to Robinson on earth but that if he accepts Jesus in his life, one day he will be able to see her in heaven \u201cand tell her in person that he\u2019s sorry.\u201d\n\nCall Randall Beach at 203-680-9345.", "publish_date": "2015-11-10"}, {"text": "OAKLEY (CBS SF) \u2013 An 11-year-old boy who was shot and killed in Oakley on Wednesday night apparently shot himself intentionally, a sheriff\u2019s spokesman said Thursday afternoon.\n\nOfficers found the boy, identified as Anthony Garcia, suffering from a gunshot wound at a home in the 1300 block of Yosemite Circle after responding to reports of a shooting shortly after 7 p.m., Contra Costa County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Jimmy Lee said.\n\nFire personnel pronounced the boy dead at the scene a short time later.\n\nIn a statement Thursday afternoon, Lee said investigators believe that \u201cthe shooting does not appear to be an accident, and that the boy was killed as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\u201d\n\nInvestigators had initially believed the shooting was accidental.\n\nAnthony went by the name \u201cA.J.\u201d and was a sixth-grader at Holy Rosary School in Antioch, said Mike Brown, spokesman for the Diocese of Oakland, which oversees the school.\n\nHe said he does not know whether Anthony had any siblings at the school.\n\nGrief counselors and Holy Rosary Church pastor Father Roberto Corral are at the school today speaking with students about Anthony\u2019s death, Brown said.\n\nStudents will be able to attend a prayer service in Anthony\u2019s honor at the Holy Rosary Church at the end of the school day, and a letter is being sent home to parents to inform them of support services that are available, he said.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2014 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

Police have not received any tips from the community, which they say is highly unusual, especially considering the number of people murdered.\n\nAccording to Chief Bob Hundley Jr. with the Paris Police Department, a female called shortly before 11:30 p.m. to report that someone was bleeding at a home in the 400 block of Northeast Sixth Street.

One of those men has been arrested on an unrelated charge. The other man has been interviewed by authorities.\n\nParis is located about 100 miles northeast of Dallas.

She was left not far from the road. Her body was found in the morning by surveyors.\n\nLast year, a jury convicted Patterson of murder, two counts of felony murder, kidnapping, robbery and hindering. At sentencing, Delehey dismissed the hindering charge and merged the murder counts. He sentenced Patterson to life without parole for murder, 30 years for kidnapping and 20 years for robbery, all to be served at the same time.\n\nPatterson appealed the conviction and his sentence. Last month, the New Jersey Appellate Division upheld the conviction, but reversed his sentence and sent the matter back to the trial court.\n\nThe appeals court found that Delehey erred in his consideration of Patterson's criminal history, in that he had been convicted in 1993 of second-degree robbery, not first-degree robbery. Patterson was also convicted of first-degree robbery in 1999. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2001 for that robbery and was paroled on Aug. 4, 2013, just months before he killed Armstrong.\n\nThe trial court incorrectly applied what is known as the \"three strikes\" rule in sentencing Patterson to life without parole, the appeals court ruled.\n\nAlso, the judge incorrectly applied a 20-year sentence on the robbery charge. The appeals court found that it should have been a second-degree offense punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison.\n\nGiven the ruling, Delehey resentenced Patterson to 10 years for the robbery charge and kept the 30-year term for kidnapping. Both will be served at the same time as the life term.\n\nDelehey was not swayed by defense attorney Anthony Rizzo's call for a 40-year term, with 85 percent to be served without the chance for parole. Rizzo argued that since the three-strikes provision was incorrectly levied and Patterson has shown good behavior in prison, he should get less than a life term.\n\nBurlington County Assistant Prosecutor LaChia Bradshaw disagreed, citing Patterson's record and his prior incarcerations, and reiterated that the murder was committed not long after he was paroled from prison.\n\nJahyda Bennett-Wilson, Armstrong's daughter, said her family continues to be affected by the murder.\n\n\"I have lost my faith and trust in people,\" Bennett-Wilson said. \"My mother had a heart as big as the world. ... It breaks my heart into pieces.\"\n\nShe was emotional when telling Delehey that a \"big part\" of her died when her mother was killed, and that she wished she could have protected her.\n\n\"She died terrified and alone,\" Bennett-Wilson said. \"Mom, you will never be forgotten.\"\n\nAfter the proceedings, Bennett-Wilson said the wounds are reopened every time the family has to come to court.\n\n\"I just want it to end so I can begin to get closure,\" she said. \"He's done enough harm to our family.\"", "publish_date": "2017-11-09"}, {"text": "Bags of cocaine and marijuana and a loaded gun put a young man behind bars.\n\nCANTON Police say the young man who left a local Walmart store without paying for a cellphone accessory was carrying a loaded gun and bags of illegal drugs.\n\nDustin Keith, 30, who has no permanent address, was arrested at the store at 3200 Atlantic Blvd. NE at 12:10 a.m. Tuesday on charges of carrying a concealed weapon, theft, possession of a controlled substance and drug possession, according to Stark County Jail records.\n\nCanton police reports show that he was carrying \"a concealed handgun with an inserted magazine containing ammunition\" when he left the store without paying for the accessory.

She also ordered him never again to have any contact with the victim\u2019s family.\n\nBell\u2019s Atlanta defense attorney Lamar Rhodes sought a more lenient penalty, asking that Bell serve only three years.\n\nAgain the father argued Bell deserved more time \u2013 of his son saying, \u201cHe\u2019s going to suffer the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nNeither Bell nor the victim would disclose any motive for the assault.\n\nBell, who disputed facts of the case as recited by Senior Assistant District Attorney Don Kelly, told Gottfried he would suffer by being separated from his son while in prison. \u201cNo hard feelings to the victim,\u201d he added. \u201cI still love him like a brother.\u201d\n\nThat was not evident from the way Bell assaulted his longtime friend earlier this year at 1052 Winston Road in Columbus, an area now infamous for shootings and homicides, authorities said.\u2018Kelly said the victim\u2019s mother dropped him off at some apartments there, where he was to meet a friend. He was outside when a car pulled up and Bell got out, covering the lower half of his face with a bandana.\n\nBell pulled out a handgun and opened fire, striking the other man in the neck, wrist and hip, the latter wound causing permanent injury. As Bell fled, the victim went to a nearby apartment for help. The resident there let him in, called the police and put pressure on the his wounds to reduce the bleeding.\n\nAs an ambulance rushed the victim to the hospital, the apartment resident reported to officers the man had told him \u201cLo,\u201d the name by which he knew Bell, had shot him. The victim later picked Bell\u2019s picture from a photographic lineup.\n\nPolice got warrants to arrest Bell, who surrendered to officers on Jan. 17.\n\nIn delivering Bell\u2019s sentence, Gottfried told Bell he was lucky the victim suffered only \u201clifelong scars,\u201d as he could have died from his wounds.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re not facing a murder charge,\u201d the judge said.\n\nIt would not have been Columbus\u2019 first or only homicide on Winston Road.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 2013, 27-year-old Terrell Screws of 8344 Twin Chapel Drive was pronounced dead at 10:49 p.m. from multiple bullet wounds sustained on the street outside 1042 Winston Road, investigators said.\n\nThis past Aug. 21, 16-year-old Christopher Jones died from a gunshot wound to the head during an exchange of fire that led to Jones\u2019 crashing his bullet-riddled car at Winston Road and Head Street.

Felony murder means they allegedly caused someone\u2019s death while committing a felony, whether they meant to or not.\n\nAlso arrested during the investigation was 44-year-old Antonio Robinson who lived in Winston Road\u2019s 1000 block. He was charged with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime and keeping a disorderly house.\n\nWinston Road residents told the Ledger-Enquirer multiple shots were fired during the incident. One witness said he heard what sounded like an automatic weapon.\n\nAbout 11 p.m. this past May 25, a man was wounded in the hand and thigh during a drive-by shooting on Winston Road. \"A car drove by, then came back by on a second pass,\" police Lt.

The first victim lost his life in Tallapoosa County, while the second befell tragedy in Blount County. Both tragic accidents could have been avoided had greater safety precautions been taken. AL.com shared the stories.\n\nThe first fatal accident took place early in the morning, just after 6:30 a.m. near Tallapoosa's Lake Martin. The victim was a hunter named James Raymond Landers, a 50-year old man who was hunting a property - supposedly a public slab of land - with a bow.\n\nUnbeknownst to Landers, a second hunter was already scanning the property from atop a tree stand, with a gun in hand. The second hunter must have mistaken Landers for a deer or some other type of game animal, because when he saw movement in the woods, he took aim and fired.\n\nThe premature shot proved fatal, leaving Landers dead and igniting a police investigation in the area. So far, the shooting has been ruled an accident and blame has not been laid upon the other hunter. Precisely what the second hunter believed he was shooting at has not yet been clarified in the news.\n\nHowever, reports indicate that Landers wasn't wearing orange reflective gear and therefore could have reasonably been mistaken as a game animal. Still, the second hunter should not have fired until he knew what he was shooting at. Mistakes were made on both sides of the gun barrel, and both of them call for greater vigilance in hunting safety for all.\n\nThe police investigator in the Tallapoosa case stated that the investigation was ongoing, but that he couldn't recall more than maybe a single other hunting fatality occurring in his jurisdiction. However, while hunting fatalities may be rare, they sometimes coincide in bizarre fashion, and that's precisely what happened in the state of Alabama last weekend.\n\nAs Landers was being mourned in Tallapoosa County on Sunday evening, another hunter was felled in Blount County - roughly two and a half miles away by car. The Blount fatality struck Adam Scott Jordan, a 37-year old hunter who, unlike James Raymond Landers, had not been hunting alone on Sunday.\n\nRealted story: What Happens When An Alabama Deer Visits A Thrift Store? [VIDEO]\n\nOn the contrary, reports indicate that Jordan was hunting with two other friends when he was injured and killed. Reports say one of the other people he was hunting with accidentally discharged their weapon, and Jordan was on the receiving end of the blast. Much like with the Tallapoosa fatality, police reports stated that neither Jordan nor his hunting buddies had been wearing orange reflective clothing. Whether that piece of the story relates in any way to how Jordan was shot, however, is still a bit unclear.\n\nIn many places around the country, hunting accidents have actually been on the decline in recent years, but as these two twin Alabama shootings prove, there is still a great need for hunting safety classes and for other rules, regulations, and behaviors that can promote safe procedures among the hunting community. Wearing orange blaze is obviously a big safeguard that hunters can have to make sure they don't end up being mistaken for a game animal. However, trigger happy hunters also need to be more careful - and to be held more accountable - for stray shots that result in serious injuries and lost lives.", "publish_date": "2014-01-18"}, {"text": "Police are investigating a gunshot death near a residence in National City around 5:15 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nOfficers are on the scene at East 18th Street and Grove Street at the site of the shooting, which might have occured in the backyard of a home.\n\nCheck back for more.", "publish_date": "2014-01-02"}, {"text": "Lenoir County investigators say stabbing victim shot attacker Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

The witness then called Brown, told him about the fight and asked him to come over, the warrant said.\n\nWhen Brown arrived at the home in the 8800 block of Stroelitz Street, he and Powell began fighting and the argument quickly turned physical. According to the warrant, a third man came into the apartment during the fight and tried to break it up.\n\nDuring the fight, the witness said they heard more than one shot fired before hearing the third man yell out, \"you shot me.\" Brown then carried the third man out of the apartment and drove him to University Medical Center, according to the warrant.\n\nAt UMC, the man was treated for a gunshot wound to the leg and Brown was treated for injuries he sustained during the fight, the warrant states.\n\nMan and woman shot to death in a car in Holy Cross neighborhood ID'd by coroner The 36-year-old woman and a 51-year-old man were shot to death in a black Acura on St. Claude Court Monday evening (March 19).\n\nAccording to the warrant, police got to the home just after 3:30 p.m., and found Powell lying on the living room floor with a woman \"by his side.\" Powell had more than one gunshot wound, the warrant states.

Today, one in four older adults plan to move to a new home to age in place.\n\nTo help seniors make plans for where to age, the five Home Instead Senior Care offices serving Northeast Pennsylvania are introducing new resources to navigate options and select what \u201chome\u201d means for individuals.\n\n\u201cWe know how important it is for older adults to feel a sense of independence as they age. For many, that means staying in the same home where they raised children and created a lifetime of memories,\u201d says Robert Vielee, owner of the Home Instead Senior Care offices in Clarks Summit and Tannersville. \u201cBut, now we also see a growing number of seniors who are choosing a new home to live in as they age. One that is better suited to their wish to remain independent. Whatever their wishes, we want to provide the resources to help with that decision and to help them make a plan.\u201d\n\nFor some seniors, the decision to look for a new home as they age is a practical one, with the top desired features including single floor living (85 percent), easy maintenance (84 percent) or low cost of maintenance (83 percent). For those who want to continue to age in their current homes, nearly two-thirds (64 percent) have also considered age-friendly modifications, such as adding grab bars to bathrooms or other safety measures.\n\nWhile many older adults have given thought to how they will age in place \u2013 and know they want to stay at home in some way \u2013 many still have work to do when it comes to finalizing plans. Just one in four seniors surveyed report having specific plans for where they will live as they become older. That\u2019s where Home Instead wants to help.\n\nThe new \u201cHome Your Own Way\u201d program from Home Instead Senior Care offers a wealth of free resources for seniors and families to assess needs and options, and to determine what aging in place might look like for them.\n\n\u201cThere are so many factors to consider when talking about where you may want to live as you age and what makes sense for you,\u201d says Alyssa Maria, owner of the Home Instead Senior Care in Luzerne. \u201cThe conversation needs to include not only the physical space, such as accessibility and safety precautions in the home, but also emotional elements such as memories, companionship and sense of community. We want to help seniors think through both these areas to determine what best fits their needs.\u201d\n\nFor older adults who want to stay in their homes \u2014 either a current or new home \u2014 some seek assistance to make it possible. A professional caregiver can help address the physical demands of aging, such as personal care or Alzheimer\u2019s care, as well as the emotional aspects, like companionship.\n\nWhether seniors age in their current home, downsize, move to a senior living community or choose to live with relatives, the goal of the Home Your Own Way program is to help them make an informed choice about where to live as they age.\n\nTo learn more about defining home your own way visit www.HomeYourOwnWay.com or, contact your local Home Instead Senior Care office or visit www.homeinstead.com for details on how seniors may navigate this important life decision.\n\nVoters should request absentee\n\nballots early for May Primary\n\nActing Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar this week encouraged eligible Pennsylvania voters to submit applications for primary election absentee ballots before the May 14 deadline.\n\nUnder the state election code, applications for absentee ballots must be received no later than one week before Election Day. For this year\u2019s May 21 primary election, the deadline falls on Tuesday, May 14. Voted ballots must be received by the appropriate county election office by 5 p.m. on Friday, May 17.\n\n\u201cThe election code sets a tight turnaround time \u2014 just four days \u2014 between the last day Pennsylvania voters can request an absentee ballot and when their completed absentee ballot must be received,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to request an absentee ballot well in advance to ensure the vote is received in time to be counted.\u201d\n\nAbsentee ballots may be cast by individuals with illnesses or disabilities, individuals who will be away from their municipality on business on Election Day, Pennsylvania students attending out-of-state colleges or universities, and deployed members of the military.\n\nCompleted ballots may be returned in person or mailed to the voter\u2019s county election office. The voted ballots must be received in the county office by 5 p.m. the Friday before the May 21 primary. A timely postmark is not sufficient.\n\nAbsentee ballots voted by members of the military deployed overseas will be received until 5 p.m. May 28 by county boards of elections.\n\nComprehensive information about absentee ballots, including a downloadable request form (PDF), can be found at the Department of State\u2019s website votesPA.com.\n\nApplicants will be asked to supply basic voter registration information and to specify a reason for applying to vote absentee.\n\nPennsylvanians applying for an absentee ballot must provide their driver\u2019s license or PennDOT ID number. If they do not have a driver\u2019s license or PennDOT ID, they must give the last four digits of their Social Security number. If a voter has neither, he or she must present a copy of an acceptable photo ID. A list of approved alternative types of identification (PDF) is available at votesPA.com.\n\nAn absentee voter can designate someone else to deliver the absentee application and ballot if he or she is physically unable to do so. Certification of Designated Agent forms (PDF) are also available online.\n\nFor additional information, call 1-877-VOTESPA (1-877-868-3772) or visit votesPA.com.\n\nDepartment of Health warns\n\nof dangers of indoor tanning\n\nDepartment of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine this week encouraged all Pennsylvanians to be aware of the dangers of indoor tanning, which can cause cancer and eye conditions.\n\n\u201cIndoor tanning is dangerous and can lead to numerous health issues that can impact individuals for the rest of their lives,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThis time of year is very popular for people, especially high-school aged students, to go into tanning booths because of events such as prom and graduation. It is important to remember that tanning is illegal for minors 16 and younger, and parents who know their minor is tanning indoors are also breaking the law. Additionally, a 17-year old is only allowed to tan with written permission from a parent or guardian.\u201d\n\nAll indoor tanning facilities are required to register with the department to operate. Those facilities that are not registered are operating illegally. All Pennsylvanians should know that tanning at an unregistered facility is against the law.\n\nEven though indoor tanning devices operate on a timer, the exposure to UV rays can vary, depending on your age and type of light bulbs used. It is possible to get a burn from indoor tanning. A tan is the body\u2019s method of responding to the effect of UV rays and is a form of injury. Having a base tan does not protect you from future damage to your skin, or from being sunburned.\n\nExposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause numerous health effects such as cataracts and eye cancer. Indoor tanning can also cause skin cancer. Types of skin cancer include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer.\n\nMelanomas often resemble moles, and some develop from moles. This is why it is so important that if you have a mole that seems abnormal or seems to be changing, to have it looked at by a physician. Melanoma that is recognized and treated early is almost always curable. If not detected early, it can spread and be fatal.\n\nMelanoma is one of the most common cancers in Pennsylvania, with nearly 3,700 new cases in 2016. One in 41 Pennsylvanians are at risk of developing melanoma in their lifetime. While nearly 90 percent of people who develop melanoma survive, in 2016, 388 people died from this cancer.\n\nAvoiding tanning and UV tanning beds is one of the best ways to prevent melanoma and other skin cancers. In addition, it is important to prevent sunburns by using sunscreen that contains broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) coverage with an SPF of 30 or higher. Newborns and others at risk of issues from the sun should prevent exposure.\n\nFor more information on indoor tanning or skin cancer, visit the Department of Health\u2019s website at www.health.pa.gov or on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nhttps://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/web1_Capitol-logo-5.jpg Boockvar https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/web1_Acting-Secretary-of-State-Kathy-Boockvar.jpg Boockvar Levine https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/web1_levine.jpg Levine\n\nBy Bill O\u2019Boyle boboyle@timesleader.com", "publish_date": "2018-03-20"}, {"text": "CLOSE A man was shot after he injured a deputy with a knife, the sheriff's office says.

They were 33 years old.\n\nThe sisters, who lived in Broomfield, were the first people in Colorado to receive deep brain stimulation \u2014 a surgery commonly used for patients with Parkinson's disease \u2014 to treat their often-debilitating symptoms of OCD.\n\nIn a spring 2016 publication printed by Littleton Adventist Hospital, where they received the surgery, the twins said they began to feel at peace with their existence after receiving the treatment in spring 2015. One year after the treatment, Sara Eldritch told the hospital, \"I feel like I can identify my anxiety. I can actually see where it's coming from. And I feel like I can deal with it.\"\n\nBut before the surgery, the story said, \"they felt at war with their own existence. And in a desperate cry for help as adolescents, they tried taking their own lives.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the sisters, coping with the disorder meant living with compulsions, such as taking 10-hour showers, 20-minute hand-washings and using dozens of bottles of rubbing alcohol to disinfect everything they touched.\n\nFor many patients with OCD, according to the hospital, unwanted thoughts become unavoidable, causing them to act on compulsions.\n\nThe deep brain stimulation was intended to inhibit overactive parts of the brain, halting anxiety and making therapy more effective. As part of the procedure, a surgeon, Dr. David VanSickle, placed electrodes on specific areas of their brains, with electrode wires under the skin of their heads, neck and shoulder.\n\nThe wires were then connected to a battery pack inserted into their chests. In programming appointments, doctors ensured that their brains received enough stimulation.\n\nOne year after the surgery, the spring 2016 publication said, the twins began finding \"hope and joy in simple things like taking a morning walk \u2014 something they hadn't done in more than a decade.\"\n\nAnd one year after the publication was printed, the twins were featured on an episode of the TV show, \"The Doctors,\" where they were taken for spa treatments separately from each other to \"help them break through their codependency,\" the show's website said.\n\nThe sisters also spent the night in two separate hotels as part of the show, where they found struggles but made it through the night, it said.\n\n\"I did kind of like the contrast of, this is what it's like to be alone, and this is what it's like to be back with my sister and friends,\" Amanda Eldritch said at the time. \"I like having two things to compare.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a news release that no other information is available at this time.\n\nSara Knuth: 719-276-7644, knuths@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "publish_date": "2018-04-02"}, {"text": "Man, 30, shot in Gresham\n\nA man was wounded in a shooting Thursday afternoon in the Gresham neighborhood on the South Side.\n\nThe 30-year-old was shot about 4 p.m. while walking in the 900 block of West 76th Street, according to Chicago Police.\n\nHe was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was stabilized, police said.", "publish_date": "2018-03-29"}, {"text": "CHICAGO (STMW) \u2014 Three people, including a pregnant woman, were shot on the Dan Ryan Expressway early Saturday.\n\nAbout 1:25 a.m., a man and three women were in a blue 2008 Buick SUV when it broke down on the 71st Street exit ramp off southbound Interstate 94, Illinois State Police said in a release.\n\nWhile they waited for help, someone in a black Dodge Charger with orange stripes pulled up and fired shots in to the SUV, striking the man and two of the women, Illinois State Police said.\n\nTwo women in the backseat were shot in the lower parts of their bodies, with a pregnant 24-year-old woman shot three times and a 19-year-old woman shot six times, police said.\n\nThe 27-year-old man, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, was shot four times \u2014 once in the chest and three times in his arm, police said.\n\nThe fourth passenger was not wounded, police said.\n\nThe man and one woman were taken to John H.

Maat said Oct. 18. \"We'll prove that the defendant had reason to know he hit someone with his car and failed to report it when he reached a place of safety.\n\n\"Other possible charges will be evaluated once the investigation is completed,\" Maat said. \"The investigation remains active, and our office urges anyone who has information to contact the Muskegon Police Deparment or Muskegon County Silent Observer.\"\n\nLamarcus Calvin\n\nCalvin's court-appointed attorney could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\n\nLove, 20, died after being transported to a local hospital. Authorities have said she was first shot, then run over by a fleeing vehicle early Sept. 22.\n\nIt happened after a shootout outside the lodge at 149 Ottawa St. that left two men dead and at least four people wounded in addition to Love. Killed by gunfire were Dupree Johnson, 20, and Ja'Colby Brown, 20.\n\nPolice had been seeking the fleeing vehicle since shortly after the incident. An arrest warrant was issued for Calvin Tuesday, Oct. 15, and he was taken into custody Wednesday, Oct. 16.\n\nAt Calvin's arraignment, Muskegon County 60th District Judge Michael J. Nolan set a family surety bond of $10,000, which was posted by Calvin's mother, on condition Calvin observe a dusk-to-dawn curfew unless with her. A family surety bond doesn't require money to be posted, only that a family member sign a form committing to pay if the defendant doesn't show up for future court dates.\n\nThat bond was a reduction from an interim cash or surety bond of $50,000 that had been set by a magistrate who signed Calvin's arrest warrant. A cash or surety bond requires a defendant to post the full amount before being released, using either his own cash or money borrowed from a bail bondsman.\n\nCalvin is the second person to be charged with a felony in connection with the events outside the Charity Lodge. Antonio Keshawn Raglin, 20, of Muskegon Heights, faces trial on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, lying to police and possessing a firearm while committing a felony, charged as a third-time habitual offender.\n\nAs of Oct. 18, no one has been charged with murder or any other assaultive crime in connection with the Charity Lodge shootout.\n\nOfficials ask that those with information call the Muskegon Police Department at (231) 724-6750 or Silent Observer at (231) 722-7463.\n\nA new Silent Observer system also allows anonymous tips via text, by texting MKGTIP plus your tip to 274637 (CRIMES).

Senior United States District Judge Margaret B. Seymour accepted the plea and will impose a sentence after she has reviewed the presentence report, which will be prepared by the U.S. Probation Office.\n\nEvidence presented at the change of plea hearing established that on January 22, 2014, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), executed a federal search warrant at CONTARTESI\u2019s Rock Hill residence after learning that CONTARTESI, a prohibited felon, was in possession of firearms and ammunition.

Wagner announced. Eloy Gonzalez-Rocha was also charged with being a deported alien found in the United States.\n\nAccording to court documents, on January 8, 2014, Fresno County Sheriff deputies investigated complaints about a strong smell of marijuana and various activities at a property in Dunlap in Fresno County. They found the brothers, who are undocumented, in a rented mobile home on the property. After obtaining a search warrant, narcotics detectives found 260 marijuana plants, more than 200 pounds of processed marijuana, $15,160 in cash, and three firearms, one of which was reported stolen from Arkansas and another having an obliterated serial number. Eloy Gonzalez-Ramirez had been deported from the United States nearly one year before he was found in Dunlap. Under federal law, illegal aliens are prohibited from possessing firearms.\n\nThis case was the product of an investigation by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office, with assistance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Assistant United States Attorney Karen A.

(WPVI) -- Authorities have identified the man who was killed in a police-involved shooting outside a Walmart store in Lehigh County.Aaron Ibrahem, 26, of Mertztown, Berks County was shot and killed by a police officer in the parking lot of the Walmart located on Mill Creek Road in Lower Macungie around 9 p.m. Wednesday.An autopsy performed Friday attributed the cause of death to multiple gunshot wounds.In a Thursday morning press conference, Captain Richard D'Ambrosio, commander of Troop M Bethlehem, said Ibrahem entered the store wearing a silicon mask and a wig.D'Ambrosio described the mask like that of Michael Myers from the 'Halloween' films, but more realistic and lifelike.Police say Ibrahem walked around the store for around 15 minutes loading up items in a cart.That's when police say a loss prevention officer spotted the man and noticed he resembled another suspect in a recent Walmart theft in Schuylkill County earlier in the month.In that theft, the officer confronted the suspect who pulled out a gun and then fled the store.As the loss prevention officer continued to follow Ibrahem, he contacted state police.According to D'Ambrosio, Pennsylvania State Police Fogelsville Barracks received the call and a trooper arrived at the store two minutes later.The trooper entered the Walmart and began searching for the loss prevention officer. He instead found Ibrahem with the shopping cart.D'Ambrosio said Ibrahem saw the trooper and left his full cart in the aisle. He then attempted to leave the Walmart.The trooper followed Ibrahem and told him to stop. D'Ambrosio said Ibrahem then took off out of the store and into the parking lot with the trooper right behind.In the parking lot, numerous witnesses saw the suspect being chased, police said.D'Ambrosio said Ibrahem pulled out a handgun from his waistband as he continued running away with his back to the trooper.The trooper, police said, continued to yell at Ibrahem to stop.As he made it to his van, Ibrahem fired a shot at the trooper, D'Ambrosio said.Ibrahem then got in the vehicle and pointed the gun at the trooper.D'Ambrosio said the trooper then fired several rounds at Ibrahem, striking him several times.Ibrahem was pronounced dead at the scene.Two more troopers arrived on the scene as the shots were being fired.Police say Ibrahem has had prior arrests.His .40 caliber Glock pistol was located on his lap, police said.The trooper was not hurt and no other injuries were reported.D'Ambrosio said the trooper is a 4-year veteran of the force and recently transferred to the barracks from Hazelton. This was his first week with the troop.The trooper involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative duty as routine in these instances, police said.An investigation into whether the shooting was justified is underway.

While there appears to be a local spike in CPL holders pulling their weapons for defense, it's impossible to say for sure. (Lauren Petracca | MLive.com)\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI \u2013 It was after 2 a.m. on a January night when a musician who had played at Yester Years Lounge left the bar on South Division Avenue and began loading band equipment into his nearby vehicle. The musician was caught off-guard when a gunman approached, stole items from the vehicle and pointed a weapon at him.\n\nThen it was the robber's turn to be surprised: The musician had a concealed pistol license and a 9 mm handgun. The suspect was hit once in the torso. The injured man's \"hollering\" made it easy for responding police to locate him. The suspect was hospitalized and later charged with armed robbery.\n\nThe Jan. 19 shooting is one of a handful of recent high-profile incidents in West Michigan pitting criminals against CPL holders. In this case and that of a fatal shooting outside the New York Fried Chicken restaurant, the CPL holders who fired their weapons were not injured. And neither of those men has been charged in connection with the shootings.\n\nIn another self-defense shooting in Ionia last September, two CPL holders involved in an argument both died in an exchange of gunfire. Police say that stemmed from road rage.\n\nThe rights of CPL holders continue to be a controversial topic in Grand Rapids and its suburbs. It\u2019s a debate that stirs people\u2019s passions, and fractures into many camps.\n\nSome have questioned how frequently CPL holders actually use their weapons. While there appears to be a local spike in these gun owners pulling their weapons for defense, it\u2019s impossible to say for sure.\n\nThat\u2019s because CPL involvement isn\u2019t factored into data that is categorized by law enforcement at a local or even a statewide level.\n\nSo the only way to track the actual frequency of self-defense shootings by CPL holders would be to pore over every shooting report individually.\n\nRelated: What does it take to get a concealed pistol license? Find out how much experience is needed\n\nIn January, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said law-abiding CPL holders could deter violent crimes. He added to the contention that more guns equal less crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a statement of ignorance when you consider there\u2019s no data,\u201d said the Rev. Jerry Bishop of Lifequest Urban Outreach Center in Grand Rapids. He has been active in anti-violence efforts in the city. \u201cThat is an inconclusive statement that has created a bunch of hype to arm people.\u201d\n\nLocal law enforcement officers say while the information would be interesting to know, it would be more relevant for legislative purposes than for policing.\n\nBut Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, whose district includes Allegan and Barry counties, argues data on self-defense shootings isn\u2019t necessary to illustrate that CPL holders prevent crimes from being carried out.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s widely accepted by the majority that if you have some sort of weapon, you\u2019re able to defend yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nANECDOTES, NOT RECORDS\n\nNew York Fried Chicken was busy the October night that two friends in their 20s ordered food from the South Division Avenue take-out restaurant following a concert in downtown Grand Rapids. The two were among an estimated three dozen customers in the parking lot when 20-year-old Delorian Taylor approached and pointed a gun at the chest of one of the men, unaware he was a CPL holder.\n\nThe man fired at Taylor from where they stood between two parked cars. Six shots hit Taylor, fatally wounding him.\n\nThe CPL holder\u2019s friend, 23-year-old Domnick Floyd, was subsequently killed by a bullet fired from an unknown person across the parking as the pair drove off. Police continue to investigate Floyd\u2019s homicide, and Kent County Prosecutor Bill Forsyth has not yet issued an opinion on whether the CPL holder \u2013 who has not been identified \u2013 was justified in killing Taylor.\n\nThe law mandates which information Michigan State Police collects on CPL holders, a spokesperson for the agency said. The state\u2019s firearms unit maintains a database that creates an annual report detailing the number of CPL holders who have licenses revoked or suspended due to criminal charges and other violations.\n\nRecord keepers with the Kent, Ionia, Allegan and Ottawa County sheriff\u2019s departments said they also don\u2019t collect records on self-defense shootings. Kent County Undersheriff Jon Hess said state police set the precedent on some crime data collection.\n\nJustifiable homicides are tracked, but reports don\u2019t distinguish whether the shooter was licensed. The only way to discern whether any shooting, fatal or not, involved a CPL holder would be to scour police report narratives, Grand Rapids Police Lt. Pat Merrill said.\n\n\u201cI know the feds are not collecting anything specific for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that. Nobody does.\u201d\n\n'COMMUNITY INJUSTICE'\n\nJeff Lodholtz, an NRA-certified CPL course instructor in Montcalm County, believes citizens who lawfully carry concealed guns deter crime. He\u2019d love to be able to present his classes with hard facts to back up the claim, but the many gray areas in guns laws could make the reporting process a \u201clogistical nightmare,\u201d he said. He noted law enforcement agencies would have to follow a shooting case from start to finish, keeping tabs on possible forthcoming charges, to be sure whether a CPL holder acted in self-defense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see the numbers. I\u2019d love to see the data. I\u2019d love to see that because it interests me,\u201d Lodholtz said. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking at it strictly as a taxpayer \u2026 I don\u2019t want somebody to come to me election time and say we need more money for this. That would just make me mad.\u201d\n\nBishop questioned why agencies collect data for countless other incidents but not self-defense shootings. He called it a \u201ccommunity injustice\u201d at a time when guns often dominate the conversation on crime.\n\n\u201cThe compassion of the community should call us to say, \u2018Hey listen, let\u2019s track this data,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAngie Jackson covers public safety and breaking news for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.

New dates have not been set. White said the lawyers and Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson will await medical clearances from Huffman's doctor or doctors.\n\nHuffman, 65, is accused of open murder for shooting his son, Jared Hufffman, on Jan. 22, 2014 inside the trailer they were sharing on Ken Drive in Spring Arbor Township.
