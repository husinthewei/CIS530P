Image\n\nCHAMPAIGN \u2014 When it comes to property crimes, there are certain stolen items that can make even the toughest police officer cringe.\n\nLike 24 brand-new handguns taken all at once.\n\nThat's how many guns thieves made off with in a smash-and-grab break-in last summer at the Rural King Supply store, 913 W. Marketview Drive, C. A week earlier, a thief made off with a single rifle from the same store.\n\n\"We hate it when one gets stolen,\" said Urbana police Sgt. Dan Morgan. \"When there's a large number in a single incident, it's a concern because of the flooding of better quality guns in the area.\"\n\nChampaign police Sgt. Dave Griffet has been keeping a running tally of the Rural King guns that have resurfaced following Aug. 25 and Sept. 3 break-ins at the store. So far, seven of the handguns have been recovered: four in Urbana and three in Champaign on five different occasions. And of that number, at least two were in the hands of men with gang affiliations.\n\nIn none of the incidents involving recovered guns was anyone shot, but two men were beaten and robbed in Urbana.\n\nThe latest recovery came Tuesday afternoon when Gabriel Chaney, 20, of Champaign, was arrested for allegedly threatening a teen with a Ruger .357 inside the Popeye's Chicken at 910 Bloomington Road, C. He was charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and aggravated assault.\n\nGriffet said police have been investigating the Rural King burglaries since they happened but have yet to learn who was responsible, even after recovering the stolen handguns. The people from whom they were recovered shed no light on the underlying burglary, he said.\n\n\"There were various makes, models and calibers,\" he said. \"They were all taken in the one event after the rifle.\"\n\nIn both break-ins, the store was apparently entered in the early morning hours through an overhead service door in what used to be the automotive department when the store was a Walmart, Griffet said.\n\n\"They broke out the glass in the doors and climbed in and entered the business to go in to steal. With the rifle, the person who came in did so in a similar fashion, ran behind the counter, grabbed the rifle and ran out,\" he said. That burglary happened at 3:45 a.m.\n\nTwo men with their faces disguised were responsible for the theft of the handguns in the Sept. 3 burglary. It happened about 2:15 a.m.\n\n\"They came in in the old automotive area, went to hardware, grabbed a sledge hammer and used it to break into the gun cases. There were alarms that did go off. However, the time delay is what allowed them to escape,\" Griffet said.\n\nPolice obtained surveillance video of both crimes, he said.\n\nHere are a few known details surrounding the recovery of the other six guns:\n\n\u2014 Sept. 19: Champaign police Sgt. Dennis Baltzell developed information that Vincent Mosley, 27, had one of the stolen guns at his home in the 1200 block of North Walnut Street in Champaign and was also selling drugs. In a court-authorized search, Baltzell found a .40-caliber semi-automatic and about 3 grams of crack cocaine. Mosley is due back in court March 4 on charges of armed violence, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.\n\n\u2014 Sept. 30, 2:40 a.m.: Urbana police responded to a shots fired call in the 2400 block of Prairie Green. Inside an apartment building hallway, an officer could hear a gun slide being pulled back. The officer made contact but none of the several adults present said they knew anything about a gun. The officer got a search warrant and found three guns, a SIG Sauer, a Walther, and a Ruger in the toilet tank. There were no arrests made and the guns were returned to Champaign police.\n\n\u2014 Jan. 5: Champaign police stopped a car for traffic violations and after smelling burned cannabis, searched it. They found a loaded Glock pistol under the front passenger seat and a backpack in the trunk with .40 caliber ammunition.\n\nArrested were Brandon Ward, 22, and Davion Hedrick, 24, both of Champaign. Ward is due back in court April 8 on a charge of possession of a stolen firearm. Hedrick was charged with possession of a stolen firearm and unlawful use of weapons by a felon. He's due in court Feb. 19.\n\n\u2014 Jan. 12: A Glock stolen from Rural King was recovered from Andrew Bell, 19, of Champaign. He was one of five men charged with armed robbery and aggravated vehicular hijacking for allegedly beating and robbing two men of cash, a cellphone and a pickup truck on Hunter Street about 3 a.m. that day. Urbana police also recovered a second handgun that was not linked to Rural King and a BB gun. Bell is due back in court Tuesday.\n\nGriffet said the retail value of the 24 handguns was put at $11,167. The stolen rifle was valued at $389.\n\n\"Many are being sold for a couple hundred to a few hundred dollars on the street when their true value is anywhere form $350 to $500,\" the officer observed.\n\nGriffet said \u2014 and Scot Kersten, Rural King's vice president of marketing and advertising confirmed \u2014 that the store had taken steps to improve the security of its weapons. Kersten declined to give any details or to say if other Rural King stores in central Illinois have had similar problems.\n\nAnyone with information on any of the stolen weapons is encouraged to call Champaign police at 217-351-4545 or Champaign County Crimestoppers at 217-373-8477. Information may also be sent anonymously online at http://www.373tips.com or by cellphone text message by sending CCTIP plus the information to CRIMES (274637).\n\nCrimestoppers will pay a reward if the information leads to an arrest.

He has not had a court appearance on the Cleveland Heights charges.\n\nLater on Friday, an 18-year-old man reported he was walking on Noble Road when someone approached him and robbed him at gunpoint. The man told police he was walking about 4:41 p.m. when a man he passed complimented his shoes. Reports said the other man lifted his jacket to show a black semiautomatic pistol tucked in his waistband.\n\nThe 18-year-old told police he gave the man $2,000 and a Kay Jewelers bag with a diamond necklace, gold necklace and gold bracelet inside. The man with the gun then ran towards Quilliams Road, reports say.\n\nThe 18-year-old ran to his girlfriend\u2019s house nearby, reports say.\n\nOn Sunday, a couple was walking about 12:30 a.m. on Coventry Road north of Mayfield Road when a man approached them and pointed a replica silver gun in their faces.

He shot and killed former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28, around 9 a.m., then went a short distance and killed Pritchett, 80, who began the company in 1980. At one time Allen, the step-grandfather of Buffalo Bills running back C.J.

One person on the list wasn't shot and was never in danger, said Lt. Lyn Williams, a Union County Sheriff's Office spokesman.\n\nBefore a Tuesday service honoring the victims, Maxwell said the service had a clear purpose.\n\n\"We hope that we're able to come together and this will be an outpouring of love from person to person, that there will be an increase in love in parts our community and there be no ill will whatsoever,\" he said. \"And that is our prayer for tonight.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nCLOSE A Tuesday service at Victory Christian Center in Lake Butler, Fla., honored those died as a result of a Saturday work-related shooting.

(Photo: Chris Crook/Times Recorder)Buy Photo\n\nA Columbus man who pleaded guilty to two separate shootings that injured four and killed one will serve 32 years to life in prison.\n\nAnthony D. Wilson, 27, appeared in Muskingum County Common Pleas Court on Monday to be sentenced on two cases. Judge Kelly Cottrill accepted the state's recommended sentence for four counts in case one, and one count in case two.\n\nWilson pleaded guilty in November to a September 2013 shooting at Hoppy's Bar on Putnam Avenue that injured four people. After an altercation, Wilson had grabbed a semi-automatic handgun from his car and opened fire on the crowd of about 50 people, officials have said.\n\nHe was charged with four counts of assault, a second-degree felony. The state dismissed three other charges, including having weapons under disability, a third degree felony, tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony, and receiving stolen property, a fourth-degree felony, in exchange for the guilty plea.\n\nCottrill sentenced Wilson to two years in prison on each count in that case, plus an additional three years on the first two counts, which carried a firearm specification, for a total of 14 years.\n\nLess than four months after that shooting, Wilson shot Isaac Thomas, 35, at a home on Spangler Drive after an argument over a stolen gun. Thomas was left outside bleeding and later died at the hospital. Authorities indicted Wilson on May 14 for the incident, eight days before his arrest.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in November to one count of murder, an unclassified felony, for Thomas' death. The state dismissed another weapons charge in exchange for the plea.\n\nCottrill sentenced him to 15 years to life on that charge, plus an additional three years for the firearm specification, for a total of 18 years.\n\nThe sentences on all charges will be served consecutively, Cottrill ruled. Cottrill said his ruling was based on a pre-sentence investigation and the danger Wilson posed to the public.\n\n\"I apologize for what I've done,\" Wilson said in court. \"If I could take it back, I would.\"\n\nThe state had reduced Wilson's charges in exchange for his testimony at Chad M. Morrison's trial last week. but he was found not guilty of complicity to commit murder for giving the order to Wilson to shoot Thomas.\n\nWilson had testified that he shot and killed Thomas on Morrison's orders after Thomas stole Morrison's .357 caliber handgun. Morrison, however, testified that Wilson had acted on his own when he shot Thomas, perhaps out of fear of retribution for the September shooting at Hoppy's.\n\nMorrison was convicted by the jury of two counts of obstructing justice for driving Wilson from the scene and lying to police the next day. Cottrill also found him guilty of a weapons charge for illegally possession a handgun based on previous drug convictions. He was sentenced to a total of five years in prison.\n\nelagatta@gannett.com\n\n740-450-6753\n\nTwitter: @EricLagatta\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1bKtkVi", "publish_date": "2015-03-30"}, {"text": "Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service.\n\nRe-enter zip code or sign up for digital access.\n\nGet digital access", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "\"I can't explain how shocking it is to hear that your pet has been shot.

His girlfriend was struck in the head, and he brought her by private transport to a local hospital for treatment.\n\nDiaz\u2019s girlfriend, now 25, suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the shooting and now resides in a nursing home; her injuries left her unable to communicate with anyone.\n\nIn trying to explain the incident to police, law enforcement agents said, Diaz claimed that he was a drug dealer and that his girlfriend had been shot as three purported masked robbers invaded their home and looked for marijuana.

The first victim lost his life in Tallapoosa County, while the second befell tragedy in Blount County. Both tragic accidents could have been avoided had greater safety precautions been taken. AL.com shared the stories.\n\nThe first fatal accident took place early in the morning, just after 6:30 a.m. near Tallapoosa's Lake Martin. The victim was a hunter named James Raymond Landers, a 50-year old man who was hunting a property - supposedly a public slab of land - with a bow.\n\nUnbeknownst to Landers, a second hunter was already scanning the property from atop a tree stand, with a gun in hand. The second hunter must have mistaken Landers for a deer or some other type of game animal, because when he saw movement in the woods, he took aim and fired.\n\nThe premature shot proved fatal, leaving Landers dead and igniting a police investigation in the area. So far, the shooting has been ruled an accident and blame has not been laid upon the other hunter. Precisely what the second hunter believed he was shooting at has not yet been clarified in the news.\n\nHowever, reports indicate that Landers wasn't wearing orange reflective gear and therefore could have reasonably been mistaken as a game animal. Still, the second hunter should not have fired until he knew what he was shooting at. Mistakes were made on both sides of the gun barrel, and both of them call for greater vigilance in hunting safety for all.\n\nThe police investigator in the Tallapoosa case stated that the investigation was ongoing, but that he couldn't recall more than maybe a single other hunting fatality occurring in his jurisdiction. However, while hunting fatalities may be rare, they sometimes coincide in bizarre fashion, and that's precisely what happened in the state of Alabama last weekend.\n\nAs Landers was being mourned in Tallapoosa County on Sunday evening, another hunter was felled in Blount County - roughly two and a half miles away by car. The Blount fatality struck Adam Scott Jordan, a 37-year old hunter who, unlike James Raymond Landers, had not been hunting alone on Sunday.\n\nRealted story: What Happens When An Alabama Deer Visits A Thrift Store? [VIDEO]\n\nOn the contrary, reports indicate that Jordan was hunting with two other friends when he was injured and killed. Reports say one of the other people he was hunting with accidentally discharged their weapon, and Jordan was on the receiving end of the blast. Much like with the Tallapoosa fatality, police reports stated that neither Jordan nor his hunting buddies had been wearing orange reflective clothing. Whether that piece of the story relates in any way to how Jordan was shot, however, is still a bit unclear.\n\nIn many places around the country, hunting accidents have actually been on the decline in recent years, but as these two twin Alabama shootings prove, there is still a great need for hunting safety classes and for other rules, regulations, and behaviors that can promote safe procedures among the hunting community. Wearing orange blaze is obviously a big safeguard that hunters can have to make sure they don't end up being mistaken for a game animal. However, trigger happy hunters also need to be more careful - and to be held more accountable - for stray shots that result in serious injuries and lost lives.", "publish_date": "2014-01-18"}, {"text": "Jesus Duarte (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO/OXNARD POLICE DEPARTMENT)\n\nA man was sentenced Wednesday to 89 years to life in prison for a 2014 double-shooting in Oxnard that killed one and injured another, prosecutors said.\n\nJesus Samuel Duarte, 38, previously pleaded guilty in January to the charges of murder, attempted murder and special allegations that he personally used a firearm in the Feb. 17, 2014 shooting.

Kilker, Shenandoah, who issued a warrant for Almonti\u2019s arrest.\n\n\n\nThe warrant will be served and Almonti arraigned after being released from the hospital.\n\n\n\nKyper said the incident leading up the shooting began when Nicole Ervolino arrived at the Girardville Police station to report a domestic assault.\n\n\n\nTomeo, who was on duty at the time, transported the woman back to the home where the assault happened and arriving there met Almonti who was outside.\n\n\n\nKyper said that Tomeo lowered the window on the police cruiser to speak with Almonti who almost immediately struck the officer in the head.\n\n\n\nAlmonti continued to hit Tomeo despite being ordered to stop. At that time, Kyper said Tomeo used his Taser weapon against Almonti but the man continued to ignore commands and aggressively resist the officer.\n\n\n\nTomeo then discharged his weapon and hit Almonti two times, the trooper said.\n\n\n\nKyper said that despite being shot Almonti still refused to obey and continued to act aggressively and when officers from neighboring communities arrived the man continued to resist, refused to lie on the ground and had to be Tased again.\n\n\n\nAt the scene, Kyper said Ervolino reported being at the home she and Almonti share watching a movie prior to the assault and that she fell asleep.

Daniel, a bouncer at Slick's Go-Go Bar in Irvington was killed on Christmas morning by a gunman who tried to enter the club, according to authorities.\n\nPolice said two or more suspects entered the bar, but Daniel, the bouncer, told them to leave after he felt a gun while patting one of the men down. A police source who asked not to be identified because the matter is under active investigation said the man stepped back and shot Daniel and Clervoyant outside the bar.\n\nA 27-year-old Irvington man and 34-year-old East Orange man were also shot and taken to University Hospital. Their names were not released.\n\nOutside the Hillside home of Woodley Daniel yesterday afternoon, at least a dozen friends and relatives gathered, crying and hugging each other.\n\n\u201cWe were born several days apart,\u201d said Noah Joseph, 32, a cousin. \u201cOur mothers carried us in their wombs at the same time.\u201d Joseph said Daniel was originally from Irvington and had moved to Hillside.\n\nOne of the victims of the Christmas morning shooting at an Irvington go-go bar was Pierre Clervoyant, 34, of Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cHe was very loved,\u201d Joseph said, voice cracking. \u201cHe had many nieces and nephews and he was a father to all of them. He was a good man with a heart of gold. Anyone who knows him will say that about him. He was a protector. He was a hero.\u201d\n\nPierre Clervoyant Sr., who owned Slick\u2019s, said two men came to the bar at around 12:30 a.m. He said they were denied entry because \u201cthey were clearly drunk.\u201d His son approached the men \u201cto calm the situation down,\u201d as their argument with Daniel moved outside. One of the men then pulled out a gun and fired, he said, killing Daniel and Clervoyant Jr., wounding two others and fatally shooting Cureton.\n\n\u201cHe was trying to be the peacemaker,\u201d said Stephanie Clervoyant, 25, the sister of the bar manager. She wore his New York Knicks pullover, gathering along with other family at their Elizabeth home.\n\nClervoyant lived upstairs from his parents with his wife, Candice Clervoyant \u2014 a maternity nurse at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston \u2014 and their daughter Jaidyn, who turned 6 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew Pierre because of his smile,\u201d she said,\u201d calling him a mentor to youth in the Haitian community. \u201cHe was better than a great father,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was excellent. He was kind and compassionate.\u201d\n\nA Facebook account for Clervoyant, a graduate of Fairleigh-Dickinson University, has a photo of his daughter as the profile picture. She sits on an ottoman, wearing flower barrettes in her hair. On both Instagram and Facebook, messages mourned the bar manager. \u201cMy prayers and condolences goes out to my Slicks family in Irvington,\u201d read one post. \u201cSuch sad news to wake up to this morning on a day like this.\u201d\n\nIn addition to managing the bar, Clervoyant worked for the city of Elizabeth, in the Office of Aging, which runs programs for seniors.\n\nElizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage, reached by email yesterday, called him \u201cA great young man who had everything going for him.\u201d\n\nPierre Clervoyant Sr. says police took a computer containing footage from surveillance cameras.\n\nActing Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray and Joseph Santiago, Irvington Police director, said Irvington Police and the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force are investigating the shooting. Its Crimestoppers program announced a $10,000 reward for information that would help in the arrest and conviction of a suspect.\n\nThe Irvington bar has been the scene of at least two other shootings in recent years.

Credit: Michael Sears\n\nSHARE\n\nBy of the\n\nA fatal shooting on New Year's Eve and a couple of nonfatal shootings concluded a violent year in Milwaukee in which more people were killed by assailants than in any since 2005.\n\nIf the unofficial tally holds up, Milwaukee will have had 106 homicides in 2013, the largest number of such deaths in the tenure of Police Chief Edward A. Flynn, who was hired more than five years ago.\n\nPolice have released few details of Tuesday's fatal shooting. A man was found on the street in the 7400 block of W. Appleton Ave. No one had been arrested Wednesday in that death, a department spokesman said.\n\nTwo other people were shot in separate cases Tuesday night, and two nonfatal shootings happened in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nAn arrest was made in one of Tuesday's shootings and one of the shootings Wednesday morning.\n\nMuch of the last year's violence occurred in August, which saw 20 homicides. That month also had the third-highest monthly number of nonfatal shootings \u2014 78 \u2014 since the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission began keeping those records in 2006.\n\nThe violence spilled over into September, when 14 more homicides were recorded.\n\nThe 2013 homicide data is preliminary, and numbers could fluctuate because several death investigations are continuing. The Milwaukee Police Department follows the FBI's national crime reporting standards, which use the date of an individual's death in crime statistics and do not include homicides ruled self-defense.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Milwaukee regularly had more than 100 homicides a year, with a high of 165 such deaths in 1991, according to those FBI standards. That pattern dropped significantly starting in 2008, the year Flynn took office.\n\nThere have been four shootings since midday Tuesday that didn't involve life-threatening injuries. According to police:\n\n\u25a0 A man was shot about 8:20 p.m. Tuesday while in the 2700 block of W. Lincoln Ave., police said. No one has been arrested in that incident.\n\n\u25a0 A 22-year-old woman was shot by a family member about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday while in the 1600 block of S. 25th St. The woman and the family member were arguing. The woman was hospitalized and the family member was taken into custody.\n\n\u25a0 A 28-year-old Milwaukee man was shot by someone who knew him about 3:45 a.m. Wednesday while he was in the 4700 block of N. 50th St. The man drove himself to a friend's house, and the friend drove him to a hospital. Police later arrested one person and they're looking for others to arrest.\n\n\u25a0 A 33-year-old Milwaukee man was shot about 5:30 a.m. Wednesday while he was in the 1400 block of S. 11th St. He told police that he was in a confrontation with someone on the street but that he didn't know the person who shot him.

But he was the latest victim in an ongoing retaliation between rival gangs, the Athens Park Bloods and Bounty Hunter Bloods.\n\n\"I guarantee you tonight there will be more -- two to three more killings or somebody will get shot in the process,\" said one neighborhood resident who declined to give his name out of fear of retaliation.\n\nAs many as 11 bullet holes riddled the two-story blue house at 1501 E. 50th St. where the boy known as Trey was struck around 11:30 p.m. Monday. He was shot once in the chest with a rifle. His mother found him wounded downstairs in their home. He died on the way to the hospital.\n\nA stray round went through a nearby home where a woman and two small children were inside.\n\n\"Whoever knows [who did this] needs to go and tell someone. That's the only way we're going stop all of this,\" said the woman, who was afraid to give her name. \"All they're going to do is retaliate against whoever they know done it. Then, they're going to retaliate back. It's just going to keep going back and forth.\"\n\nChattanooga Mayor Andy Berke, who hopes to have his public safety initiative rolled out in the next couple of months to help stem the tide of violence, said this shooting in particular struck a chord. His daughter is a 13-year-old eighth-grader.\n\n\"We have an innocent victim. We have innocent neighbors,\" Berke said in an interview. \"Whether the bullet went through your home or not, there are a lot of people who are in fear because of these incidents. We've been working to get Chattanooga Violence Reduction Initiative off the ground for exactly these reasons. We aren't powerless to do anything.\"\n\nThe initiative focuses on the city's violence. Offenders are shown the evidence against them and offered a chance: change their lives or spend a long time in a federal prison.\n\n\"In the meantime, we are using every possible resource to find the people who are responsible for last night's shooting and to prevent retaliation in whatever way possible,\" Berke said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Deontrey's uncle, Rodney \"Rah-Rah\" Southers, a Rollin 20's Bloods member, was picked up on a domestic assault warrant with a $10,000 bond. He was placed on a 12-hour hold. The hope is he will stay locked up until tempers calm or investigators find Deontrey's killer or killers.\n\nPolice were also looking to pick up others who might try to retaliate.\n\nBullet holes are visible Tuesday in the exterior of a home on East 50th Street where a 13-year-old boy was shot to death Monday night in Chattanooga.

The family declined comment for this report.\n\nHe is remembered as a boy who loved to play football. His academics were improving.\n\n\"Just a typical middle school kid. Middle school is always those rocky years. Then, in eighth grade, you see them start seeing the light.

While there appears to be a local spike in CPL holders pulling their weapons for defense, it's impossible to say for sure. (Lauren Petracca | MLive.com)\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI \u2013 It was after 2 a.m. on a January night when a musician who had played at Yester Years Lounge left the bar on South Division Avenue and began loading band equipment into his nearby vehicle. The musician was caught off-guard when a gunman approached, stole items from the vehicle and pointed a weapon at him.\n\nThen it was the robber's turn to be surprised: The musician had a concealed pistol license and a 9 mm handgun. The suspect was hit once in the torso. The injured man's \"hollering\" made it easy for responding police to locate him. The suspect was hospitalized and later charged with armed robbery.\n\nThe Jan. 19 shooting is one of a handful of recent high-profile incidents in West Michigan pitting criminals against CPL holders. In this case and that of a fatal shooting outside the New York Fried Chicken restaurant, the CPL holders who fired their weapons were not injured. And neither of those men has been charged in connection with the shootings.\n\nIn another self-defense shooting in Ionia last September, two CPL holders involved in an argument both died in an exchange of gunfire. Police say that stemmed from road rage.\n\nThe rights of CPL holders continue to be a controversial topic in Grand Rapids and its suburbs. It\u2019s a debate that stirs people\u2019s passions, and fractures into many camps.\n\nSome have questioned how frequently CPL holders actually use their weapons. While there appears to be a local spike in these gun owners pulling their weapons for defense, it\u2019s impossible to say for sure.\n\nThat\u2019s because CPL involvement isn\u2019t factored into data that is categorized by law enforcement at a local or even a statewide level.\n\nSo the only way to track the actual frequency of self-defense shootings by CPL holders would be to pore over every shooting report individually.\n\nRelated: What does it take to get a concealed pistol license? Find out how much experience is needed\n\nIn January, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said law-abiding CPL holders could deter violent crimes. He added to the contention that more guns equal less crime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a statement of ignorance when you consider there\u2019s no data,\u201d said the Rev. Jerry Bishop of Lifequest Urban Outreach Center in Grand Rapids. He has been active in anti-violence efforts in the city. \u201cThat is an inconclusive statement that has created a bunch of hype to arm people.\u201d\n\nLocal law enforcement officers say while the information would be interesting to know, it would be more relevant for legislative purposes than for policing.\n\nBut Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, whose district includes Allegan and Barry counties, argues data on self-defense shootings isn\u2019t necessary to illustrate that CPL holders prevent crimes from being carried out.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s widely accepted by the majority that if you have some sort of weapon, you\u2019re able to defend yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nANECDOTES, NOT RECORDS\n\nNew York Fried Chicken was busy the October night that two friends in their 20s ordered food from the South Division Avenue take-out restaurant following a concert in downtown Grand Rapids. The two were among an estimated three dozen customers in the parking lot when 20-year-old Delorian Taylor approached and pointed a gun at the chest of one of the men, unaware he was a CPL holder.\n\nThe man fired at Taylor from where they stood between two parked cars. Six shots hit Taylor, fatally wounding him.\n\nThe CPL holder\u2019s friend, 23-year-old Domnick Floyd, was subsequently killed by a bullet fired from an unknown person across the parking as the pair drove off. Police continue to investigate Floyd\u2019s homicide, and Kent County Prosecutor Bill Forsyth has not yet issued an opinion on whether the CPL holder \u2013 who has not been identified \u2013 was justified in killing Taylor.\n\nThe law mandates which information Michigan State Police collects on CPL holders, a spokesperson for the agency said. The state\u2019s firearms unit maintains a database that creates an annual report detailing the number of CPL holders who have licenses revoked or suspended due to criminal charges and other violations.\n\nRecord keepers with the Kent, Ionia, Allegan and Ottawa County sheriff\u2019s departments said they also don\u2019t collect records on self-defense shootings. Kent County Undersheriff Jon Hess said state police set the precedent on some crime data collection.\n\nJustifiable homicides are tracked, but reports don\u2019t distinguish whether the shooter was licensed. The only way to discern whether any shooting, fatal or not, involved a CPL holder would be to scour police report narratives, Grand Rapids Police Lt. Pat Merrill said.\n\n\u201cI know the feds are not collecting anything specific for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that. Nobody does.\u201d\n\n'COMMUNITY INJUSTICE'\n\nJeff Lodholtz, an NRA-certified CPL course instructor in Montcalm County, believes citizens who lawfully carry concealed guns deter crime. He\u2019d love to be able to present his classes with hard facts to back up the claim, but the many gray areas in guns laws could make the reporting process a \u201clogistical nightmare,\u201d he said. He noted law enforcement agencies would have to follow a shooting case from start to finish, keeping tabs on possible forthcoming charges, to be sure whether a CPL holder acted in self-defense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see the numbers. I\u2019d love to see the data. I\u2019d love to see that because it interests me,\u201d Lodholtz said. \u201cIf I\u2019m looking at it strictly as a taxpayer \u2026 I don\u2019t want somebody to come to me election time and say we need more money for this. That would just make me mad.\u201d\n\nBishop questioned why agencies collect data for countless other incidents but not self-defense shootings. He called it a \u201ccommunity injustice\u201d at a time when guns often dominate the conversation on crime.\n\n\u201cThe compassion of the community should call us to say, \u2018Hey listen, let\u2019s track this data,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAngie Jackson covers public safety and breaking news for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.

Officers located Norman and the vehicle he was driving on Interstate 45 South on Feb. 12, 2014.\n\nOfficers attempted a traffic stop, but Norman jumped out and fled on foot, while the passenger drove away in the vehicle. Norman was chased on foot across all lanes of the highway, over retaining walls and along both feeder roads. He briefly stumbled and officers approached. Testimony revealed Norman then reached into his pocket, removed a silver and black .38 caliber revolver and threw it on the ground.\n\nHe was soon apprehended and found in possession of five rounds of .38 caliber ammunition.\n\nNorman, a convicted felon, is prohibited from possession firearms or ammunition.\n\nHis defense contended that there were no other witnesses who saw him throw the weapon to the ground. His wife also testified and claimed she had never seen him with a gun or ammunition. The jury was not convinced and found him guilty on both counts as charged.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Hittner, who presided over the trial, has set sentencing for Oct. 31, 2014.

Seven people, including the shooter, were killed in the incident. The shooter was identified by police as 42-year-old Pedro Alberto Vargas, a resident of Hialeah, who, after setting his apartment ablaze, opened fire from his balcony and inside the apartment, then held two people hostage before being fatally shot by a SWAT team in the early hours of July 27.\n\nEvents [ edit ]\n\nPrior to the shooting [ edit ]\n\nAt 1:37 p.m., hours before the shooting started, Vargas called 9-1-1 and reported he was being followed, asking the dispatcher to run the license plate of a vehicle parked outside his apartment. He also claimed he was being threatened by people using witchcraft on him. His mother, 83-year-old Esperanza Patterson, then took the phone and told the dispatcher about her son's strange behavior. The dispatcher informed Patterson that police units have been sent to her residence, but Patterson advised against it, and later informed the dispatcher that Vargas had left, having gone to the office of a lawyer he hired for a recent legal matter.[3]\n\nThe shooting [ edit ]\n\nAccording to officials, Vargas poured combustible liquid on $10,000 in cash and set it on fire in his apartment unit at around 6:30 p.m.[4][5][6] The Todel Apartments' manager, 79-year-old Italo Pisciotii, and his 69-year-old wife Samira noticed the smoke and ran to the apartment. Vargas stepped into the hallway and opened fire with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic pistol, killing both.[1][7][8][9] He proceeded to go his balcony on the fourth floor of the building and fired 10 to 20 bullets into the street, fatally hitting 33-year-old Carlos Gavilanes as he got out of his car.[7][8][9]\n\nVargas then kicked open the door of apartment 304, where he shot and killed the residents, 64-year-old Patricio Simono, his 51-year-old wife Merly Niebels, and their 17-year-old daughter Priscilla Perez;[8][9][10][11] Priscilla Perez was reportedly shot while she was hiding inside a bathtub.[12] Police officers responded to the scene and exchanged gunfire with Vargas throughout the complex's stairwells for about five hours.[13][14]\n\nVargas then entered apartment 525, where he took the residents, Zoeb and Farida Nek, hostage for about three hours. During the standoff, he continued firing shots at officers outside. After negotiations reportedly broke down, authorities decided to send in a six-officer SWAT team to rescue the hostages. The team entered the building and found the two hostages praying in the living room, while Vargas was pacing around out of their view. Officers outside distracted Vargas with a stun grenade, allowing the SWAT team to rescue the hostages and open fire on Vargas, who they gunned down after a brief shootout. Both hostages escaped unharmed. Two fully loaded magazines were found at the scene.[14][6][8][9][13][15]\n\nThe event was the deadliest mass shooting in Hialeah's history,[16] as well as the deadliest in the entire Miami area in three decades.[17]\n\nVictims [ edit ]\n\nItalo Pisciotti, 79 (building manager, killed in a hallway)\n\nSamira Pisciotti, 69 (wife of Italo Pisciotii, killed in a hallway)\n\nCarlos Javier Gavilanes, 33 (killed on the street)\n\nPatricio Simono, 64 (killed in apartment 304)\n\nMerly S. Niebles, 51 (wife of Patricio Simono, killed in apartment 304)\n\nPriscilla Perez, 17 (daughter of Patricio Simono and Merly Niebles, killed in apartment 304)\n\nThe perpetrator [ edit ]\n\nPedro Alberto Vargas (October 3, 1970[15] \u2013 July 27, 2013), a Cuban native, was identified as the shooter. He was born in Havana to teachers, and his father died in 1991 or 1992. Vargas studied at the University of Pedagogical Sciences between 1990 and 1994, graduating with a bachelor's degree in technical education.[15]\n\nHe and his mother Esperanza Patterson immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s after winning U.S. visa lotteries,[15] and Vargas was naturalized in 2004. According to records, he resided in apartment 408 with Patterson since 1999[3][14][15] and had committed no serious criminal offenses.[18][19] He took classes at Miami Dade College, graduating in 2004 with an associate degree in graphic design.[15]\n\nNeighbors described Vargas as a quiet man who commonly got into arguments with his mother in their apartment.[5][20] According to several LA Fitness customers, Vargas frequented the local gym and often lifted weights as a way to channel out pent-up anger. He also used steroids and expressed frustration at bad experiences with women.[13] The Glock 9mm pistol used in the shooting was legally purchased by Vargas in 2010 from a local gun shop, and he had a concealed carry permit for it.[4][18][14]\n\nProfessional problems [ edit ]\n\nHe worked at the media services department at Miami Dade College's North Campus starting in 2004,[21] and although his initial performance evaluations judged him positively, they began noting a lack of social skills. Vargas was eventually forced to resign in 2008 after the school found he downloaded inappropriate files, including a computer hacking tutorial from The Anarchist Cookbook. Several months afterward, Miami Dade College received anonymous online threats that were traced to a public library in Hialeah, though Vargas was suspected of being the sender. Vargas later found employment at a Miami company as a graphic designer, but was fired after three months. Like Miami Dade College, the company later received anonymous threats and Vargas was suspected, but not confirmed as the sender.[15]\n\nPrior to the shooting, Vargas had been working as a graphic design artist for Bullet Line, a promotional company, from May to October 2012. Recently, he had been seeing an attorney, Angel Castillo, Jr., regarding \"abusive emails and text messages\" that were being sent to Bullet Line, starting a week after Vargas's dismissal. He initially denied sending the messages but later admitted to being the sender after being informed by the lawyer that he was possibly committing perjury. On the day of the shooting, after making the 9-1-1 call, Vargas had gone to Castillo's office and demanded to see him, only to learn he was not there at the time. According to a relative of his mother, Vargas feared losing his money due to the case.[3][15]\n\nReaction [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the incident, Mayor Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez responded, \"I'm torn apart. We've never had something so complex as we had last night.... It's an extremely sad day in Hialeah.\"[9] In the wake of the shooting, some citizens of Hialeah took to Twitter to express their concerns about safety in the city.[22] On July 28, 2013, Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit organization that was formed in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, issued a statement about the shooting, saying, \"Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not.

But a local gun rights group says the man did nothing wrong and the arrest was unlawful.\n\nMichael Keoughan, a 27-year-old U.S. Army veteran, was walking through the small town around lunch time with a rifle strapped across his back when the disturbance started, local media reports.\n\n\u201cI was driving down Main Street to go get lunch and I saw a man with a rifle on his back,\u201d explained Angela Arthur, who snapped a picture of the man and called 911 along with several other people. \u201cI was gonna stop at Allsups but then I thought he maybe was gonna go in there so I changed my mind and just went somewhere else because it\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nA short time later, a nearby middle school was placed on lockdown as Keoughan was surrounded by the police, eventually being arrested for disorderly conduct and displaying a weapon in a manner calculated to cause alarm.\n\nKeoughan, along with others, believe his arrest was unlawful, as in the state of Texas it is legal to openly carry long arms provided they are displayed in a non-threatening and non-alarming manner.\n\nEven Arthur, who called 911, admitted that Keoughan wasn\u2019t acting in a threatening manner.\n\n\u201cHe was just calmly walking,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think anything of it unless he didn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d\n\nAnd according to Keoughan he \u201chad great interactions throughout the entire day until the police showed up.\u201d\n\nStephanie McDonald, a member of Midland chapter of the gun rights group \u201cCome and Take It\u201d also believes Keoughan\u2019s arrest was unlawful.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really a valid charge when he was just walking down the street with his rifle across his back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t across his front, he wasn\u2019t carrying it in his hands, he wasn\u2019t brandishing it. It was simply strung across his back.\u201d\n\nKeoughan was actually out that afternoon searching for a suitable route for a weekend rally hosted by the group, whose primary goal is to educate and inform the public about the legalities of open carry.\n\nPart of the reason Keoughan\u2019s arrest came as such a shock to the group was that they believed they had \u201cassurances\u201d from Police Chief Bud Jones that something like this would not occur again. However, Jones believed that their \u201cassurances\u201d were more of a miscommunication.\n\n\u201cIf an individual on his own wants to do that, he, out of the common courtesy, should contact us. That\u2019s what I told them,\u201d Jones said, adding, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who he was, had no clue, but we started getting a mass number of phone calls, by displaying the weapon, he caused undue alarm.\u201d\n\nJones, who said the gun rights group has his full support, stated that his main concern is for the protection of the people in the community.\n\n\u201cThis is the issue that they don\u2019t want to address that we have to address,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen we get a call about a person with a gun, do we ignore it? Walking down the street? They\u2019re alluding to the fact that we don\u2019t have any right to make contact to them because they\u2019re not doing anything wrong. I beg to differ with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell anybody, they say they don\u2019t have to, and yeah they probably don\u2019t, but when they disrupt the community like they did, something has to happen,\u201d Jones later told a local CBS affiliate.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a hostile environment, but again you have an armed individual and I\u2019m not going to go into detail on what we consider a hostile environment,\u201d Jones added.\n\nHowever, Keoughan doesn\u2019t argue with law enforcement\u2019s right to investigate the situation, what he doesn\u2019t agree with is the fact that he was still arrested and charged with what he feels are false accusations.\n\n\u201cJust because someone calls in and says they\u2019re alarmed doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an actual threat in the carrying,\u201d McDonald agreed. \u201cIt can be alarming to some, I understand that but that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re here. To educate the public and get the word out that we\u2019re not the enemy.

After an initial appearance Friday in Augusta District Court, he was released on unsecured bail that bars him from contacting the victim.\n\nHowever, conditions approved by a judge made him the first person in Maine to be monitored electronically by a district attorney\u2019s office before a trial, Maloney said.\n\nIt\u2019s being done under a first-of-its-kind program in Maine announced by Maloney\u2019s office in August. It provided money to Somerset County to rent GPS devices to be used for tracking the movement of people charged with domestic-violence crimes.\n\nMoney to start the program was raised at an event sponsored by the family of Amy Bagley Lake, of Dexter, who was shot and killed in 2011 alongside her two children by her estranged husband and their father, Steven Lake, who killed himself afterward.\n\nIn Domasinsky\u2019s case, Maloney said the defendant agreed to the monitoring after the victim asked for it.\n\nMaloney said his medical condition makes it impossible for him to be held in jail \u2014 he has a tracheostomy, feeding tubes and two types of cancer \u2014 but he still can walk and drive and could harm the victim.\n\nThe victim is \u201cterrified that he has nothing to lose,\u201d Maloney said, \u201cso she wanted something to keep her safe.\u201d\n\nThe device is programmed to send a signal to the Somerset County Regional Communications Center if someone in the program enters an area from which he or she is banished by bail conditions.

He pulled the trigger, but she said she deflected the shotgun\u2019s barrel and suffered only powder burns to her shoulder. After that, he hit her with the gun\u2019s barrel, loaded it and shot himself.\n\nShe fled at that point and thought she was wounded when she reached the home of a neighbor a quarter-mile away. The neighbor called 911 and Domasinsky drove to the neighbor\u2019s home, but the homeowner armed himself and asked Domasinsky to leave.\n\nWhen police arrived, they found Domasinsky sitting in his truck at his home, conscious. He was taken to Maine Medical Center in Portland by a LifeFlight helicopter. Domasinsky\u2019s aggravated assault charge is a class B felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nMaloney said the GPS device was put on his right ankle.

That's 15 of our 40 entries in this installment. And continuing the pattern, several did so while happily and unconcernedly carrying their hand-held instant death machines among you, while out shopping, dining or otherwise enjoying the amenities. Were you in Chipotle in Sandy, Utah, last week? Walmart in Hattiesburg, Mississippi? Sam's Club in Waterloo, Iowa? Perhaps the YMCA in Austin, Texas? Maybe you weren't, but people who were certain they knew how to properly handle their firearms were. And guess where they found out that they weren't really up to the task? Right in the middle of the crowds, of course! Miraculously, only one car window and one ass (anatomically speaking) were damaged. You can thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that none of the children at their swimming lessons at the Y were shot when mom blew a hole in her purse rummaging around down in Austin.\n\nA few \"coincidences\" worthy of note this time around: two people accidentally discharged their weapons while giving demonstrations of how safe they were, one lodging a bullet in his living room floor, and one lodging a bullet in a place that stopped him from living and left him on the floor. Last week also saw two young men accidentally shoot their mothers, one in Oconee Co., South Carolina, and one in Dayton, Nevada. And although this one doesn't exactly fit, an Orlando, Florida, man accidentally fired his gun twice while he was cleaning it (of course). His first shot flew through his garage door and into the street, where it blasted a hole in a passing car, and microseconds thereafter, the 12-year-old girl inside it. So flustered by this accident was he that he fired a second shot through his own thigh.\n\nThere were three \"home invasion\" shootings, in which civic-minded patriots opt to share their used ammunition with neighbors. The most worthy of note being the Marion, Ohio, accident in which a good guy with a shotgun decided to participate in the prayer meeting in the downstairs apartment. His testimony was witnessed by two of the ladies of the assembly.\n\nOutside of those noteworthy items, we saw the usual assortment of accidents. One hunting accident, one accident while \"fixing\" a gun, one target shooting mishap, one stray bullet shooting, and one cop's gun that went off when it was grabbed by a suspect.

Instead, Parker said the release came after discussion among the mayor's office, police department and city legal department once HPD had completed its internal investigation.\n\nParker and Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland described the decision to release the video as an effort toward \"transparency.\" The video, which shows the initial interaction between Baker and the officer but not the shooting, came two days after officials refused demands by the family and local activists to release it.\n\n\"It has been the legal department's position that because there is pending litigation we shouldn't release it,\" Parker said. \"And I respect the legal department but I don't always agree with them.\"\n\nWhen asked if the release of the video should have been handled differently, Parker said it could have happened more quickly. She said the city needs a uniform policy on releasing any type of HPD-related video, especially as Houston rolls out a body-worn camera program next year for officers.\n\n\"I think it could have been sooner handled,\" Parker said. \"I just want to make sure that as videos are released in the future, it's done by policy and by schedule \u2013 not by what's on the video itself. If it's embarrassing, it's embarrassing. If it has the potential to incite people, we have to know that and we have to handle how the video is released in a way that's safe. It shouldn't be 'well there's nothing on it, we can release it' \u2014 that's not good public policy. That's not transparency. That's not what we want to have happen.\"\n\nIn a brief statement, McClelland said he allowed access to the footage \"in the interest of public trust and transparency,\" noting that it was obtained from private entities.\n\n\"During the course of the investigation, no video evidence was discovered or recovered that captured the shooting incident,\" the chief said.\n\nThe lawsuit and video release come a week after authorities in Chicago charged a police officer with first-degree murder following a judge's order to release dashcam video that contradicted the longstanding official account of a black 17-year-old's shooting death 13 months earlier.\n\nThe complaint asserts that Baker was \"shot and killed without any lawful justification\" and accuses off-duty officer Juventino Castro of considering Baker a suspect because he was a black man in a hoodie.\n\nActivists and supporters of Baker, his mother and young son assembled outside HPD headquarters on Monday to demand the release of footage they believe could show elements of the Jan. 16, 2014 shooting.\n\nOn Monday, HPD spokesman John Cannon confirmed the existence of footage from the incident, but would not reveal the source, the contents or whether the video showed Baker's death. The department also released a statement saying that because of potential litigation, \"HPD will not release any evidence regarding this case at this time as permitted by the Texas Government Code.\"\n\nThe statement also asserted that Castro's actions were \"within compliance with departmental policy and state law\" and noted that that case had been reviewed by the Independent Police Oversight Board and a Harris County grand jury, which cleared the officer of criminal wrongdoing in December 2014.\n\nProtestors on Monday demanded the release of the video, which is mentioned several times in the new lawsuit.\n\nJanet Baker, the deceased man's mother, sued on behalf of his estate. Named defendants are the City of Houston, Castro and RPI Management Co. \u2013 operator of the strip mall in northwest Houston strip mall that hired the officer to provide security.\n\nCastro told his supervisors that he stopped Jordan Baker, who was riding a bicycle in the shopping center near West Little York and Antoine, because he fit the description of people accused in recent burglaries. The officer, a 10-year veteran at that time, said Baker reacted uncooperatively when approached and ran into an alley behind the strip mall. Authorities have said the shooting happened behind the stores after Baker reached into his waistband.\n\nFearing for his life, police said, Castro fired once and struck Baker.\n\nHarris County civil rights division prosecutor Julian Ramirez said last December that there were no witnesses to the shooting beyond Castro.\n\nThe lawsuit lays out two longstanding complaints about the Houston Police Department: That black men are racially profiled as a pattern and practice of enforcement and at rates twice as high as their population as well as that HPD tolerates excessive force by failing to discipline officers who simply say they fired because they thought someone had a weapon.\n\nBaker worked part time in manufacturing. The lawsuit said he also was a college student.\n\nThe hoodie-as-suspicious-clothing allegation in recent history dates back to the fatal shooting of 17-year-old black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Florida.\n\nThe Baker filing makes numerous federal and state claims for damages, including excessive deadly force, unlawful seizure and detention, equal protection, failure to provide medical care, assault and battery, municipal liability, wrongful death and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nJanet Baker is represented by the Chicago law firm of Loevy & Loevy, which has made police misconduct one of its specialty practice areas and describes itself as winning more multi-million dollar jury verdicts in the last decade than any other civil rights firm in the country.\n\nOver the last year, supporters and activists in Houston have not allowed the memory of Jordan Baker or the circumstances of his death to fade into memory. The 26-year-old became a local emblem of the national Black Lives Matter movement. His life was honored by a candlelight vigil held in the parking lot of the shopping center and in numerous demonstrations over the last year. Janet Baker was present at the September court hearing where relatives of Robbie Tolan, the aspiring professional baseball player who survived a 2008 shooting by Bellaire police, expected jury selection in their federal lawsuit to begin but ended up agreeing to a $110,000 settlement.", "publish_date": "2015-12-02"}, {"text": "News and Information from the Prince George's County Police Department", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "", "publish_date": "2014-01-28"}, {"text": "Kenneth Wayne Enslow, 84, Neosho, MO, passed into eternal rest April 11, 2019 at his home in rural Neosho.

The man also is being investigated for first-degree assault in Island County.\n\nOttersen is accused of shooting two acquaintances on Camano Island and then leading police on a high-speed chase into Mukilteo.\n\nOf the two people who were shot on the island, one, a 44-year-old man, remains at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. The other, a woman, was treated and released for a gunshot wound.\n\nThe victims were sitting in a car in the 500 block of Michelle Drive at about 3:15 p.m. when Ottersen reportedly approached the driver\u2019s side window and asked for cigarettes.\n\nOne of them handed Ottersen a pack of cigarettes. Ottersen grabbed the pack and then \u201cpulled out a firearm and without warning or provocation shot (the male victim) in the head,\u201d detectives were told.\n\nThe bullet went into the left side of the man\u2019s face and out the right side of his neck, according to court papers. The same bullet went through the woman\u2019s arm.\n\nThe victims\u2019 injuries were consistent with their statements, detectives wrote in a search warrant affidavit.\n\nThe gunman then drove off in a 2001 Toyota Camry.\n\nTwo Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies spotted the car a few miles away on Highway 532 near Stanwood. They attempted to pull Ottersen over but he took off eastbound, reaching speeds of 100 mph.\n\nThe chase continued onto southbound I-5 at similar speeds. Ottersen reportedly was weaving through lanes and using the shoulder to pass.\n\nA Washington State Patrol trooper joined in the pursuit on I-5. An Everett police officer also joined as the chase wound westbound onto Highway 526 toward Mukilteo.\n\nDuring the chase, Ottersent reportedly called 911 and told the dispatcher he had shot someone in Stanwood. He said he was in a pursuit and he \u201cwould not stop,\u201d according to the warrant.\n\nHe then drove into Mukilteo.\n\nAt the intersection of 92nd Street SW and 53rd Avenue West, a deputy tried to ram the Camry to cause Ottersen to lose control, an effort known as a \u201cPIT maneuver.\u201d The PIT maneuver wasn\u2019t successful, and Ottersen continued northbound on 53rd Avenue West.\n\nWhile turning westbound on 88th Street SW, Ottersen lost control and the Camry went into a ditch. That was at about 3:50 p.m.\n\nPolice caught up a few seconds later.\n\nThree neighbors heard the commotion and looked outside.\n\nThe three reportedly told investigators that they saw Ottersen get out of his car and wait for officers to arrive. At first, Ottersen appeared to follow the officers\u2019 commands and put his hands up. Then he suddenly grabbed a handgun from his waist.\n\nAll three witnesses said Ottersen pointed the gun at police, according to the warrant.\n\nThe search warrant provides additional detail from the confusing conclusion of the chase. Shortly after the suspect\u2019s car was rammed, police-radio traffic captured officers reporting that shots were fired. Then the officers reported the suspect was at gunpoint. Seconds later, police again reported shots fired. They said the suspect was down and in need of medical aid.\n\nInvestigators have not yet said whether Ottersen fired his weapon at the officers.\n\nAs of Friday, he remained at Harborview. He is expected to face charges in Snohomish and Island counties.\n\nThe Mukilteo shooting is being investigated by the Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team. The team includes detectives from around the county who probe cases where police use potentially fatal force.\n\nThe SMART team sought a judge\u2019s permission to search the Toyota Camry for potential evidence. They especially were interested in Ottersen\u2019s cellphone and whether he still had the pack of cigarettes from Camano Island.\n\nFour officers who were involved in the Mukilteo gunfire.

Another warrant filed in Hennepin County describes a battle between members of the \u201cGotta Have it\u201d and the \u201cHustle Made\u201d cliques.\n\nSPPD investigators say there has been a long on-going feud between different cliques of the Selby Side street gang that include homicides, weapons related offenses and aggravated assaults.\n\nThe search warrant names the men involved in the shootings. However, I didn\u2019t name them because I couldn\u2019t determine if charges were filed in Hennepin County in relation to the incidents.\n\nNovember\n\nGrievous gunshot wounds\n\nAccording to court documents, on Nov. 16, a man identified as CS went to North Memorial Hospital in Robbinsdale with a gunshot wound. Police say CS was struck three times, once in the penis. CS identified the shooter and police are investigating the case.\n\nMpls police: rival gang members present during Lake St. restaurant shooting death\n\nAccording to court documents, MPD investigators say gang members from the Latin Kings and the Sureno-13s frequented the restaurant where Luis Alejandro Torres-Sanchez, 32, was shot and killed on Nov. 25.\n\nPolice say Torres-Sanchez has an affiliation with the Sureno 13s. They say prior to the shooting, he approached an \u201cadmitted affiliated member of the Latin Kings and wanted to fight; no physical confrontation took place.\u201d\n\nAccording to police, witnesses, including Latin Kings-affiliated customers and staff learned that the LK affiliated patrons used their cellular phones prior to the shooting.\n\nPolice say video footage at the scene showed, \u201cOne of the Latin King patrons goes out front and waits in a vehicle, the staff/security goes to the restroom located in the rear of the building and the third party moves away from the front window. The shooter then walks up and fires at the victims seated by front window.\n\nPolice are requesting, through an administrative subpoena to Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon, all cell tower activity on Nov. 25 between 1 and 1:45 a.m. \u201cYour affiant further believes the requested cell tower activity\u2026will tend to place an identified suspect in the area of 1611 E Lake st\u2026at the time of the homicide, which would assist in establishing probable cause to make an arrest in the homicide investigation,\u201d reads the warrant.\n\nDecember\n\nGun threat investigation focuses on man convicted in earlier gun case\n\nMinneapolis police are investigating charges that Mohamed Elmi, 27, pointed a gun at two people and threatened their lives. According to court documents, on Dec. 15, Elmi\u2019s BMW was repossessed after he failed to make payments on the vehicle.\n\nPolice say Elmi was angry and pointed a gun at two employees of Star Auto on West Lake Street and told them, \u201cYou gonna die tonight! You not going to live!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s the same guy who pleaded guilty to terroristic threats earlier in the year: On Feb. 1, a woman honked at Mohamed Ahmed Elmi, who was in a car blocking her way. Elmi responded by yelling at her, \u201cI will shoot you in your mouth, b****.\u201d And he lifted his shirt to show her a handgun. Elmi, 26, was charged with one count of terroristic threats.\n\nPolice say they believe Elmi is still on probation for this offense.\n\nAssault rifle in a diaper bag\n\nMinneapolis police arrested Steven Charles Perkins, 37, for illegally possessing a firearm at a home in north Minneapolis on Dec. 12. They found a loaded, semi-automatic handgun. They also found a 9 mm Kel Tec assault rifle with a 50 round drum in a diaper bag.\n\nPerkins was charged with illegal possession of a firearm.\n\nUpdate: On Jan. 13, 2014, the charges were dropped. In a court document, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman explained, \u201cDefendant does not have predicate offenses to support the felony charge.\u201d\n\nReckless discharge after \u2018Full Metal Jacket\u2019\n\nA Maple Grove man was charged with accidentally shooting a woman in his apartment. According to the complaint, on Dec. 8, Timothy Ross Duea, 30, was showing the woman his loaded .40-caliber Sig Sauer pistol.\n\nOfficers say the woman told them she and Duea watched the movie \u201cFull Metal Jacket.\u201d After the movie the woman, \u201cmentioned she wanted to get a conceal and carry permit and asked to see Defendant\u2019s handgun.\u201d She handed the gun back to Duea and when he placed his hand on the gun, \u201cit went off.\u201d Duea says he doesn\u2019t remember \u201cfeeling himself pull the trigger.\u201d He told officers the shooting was accidental.\n\nHospital staff later determined the bullet passed through the woman\u2019s right index finger, entered her upper chest area and exited through her left arm. She also suffered a bruised lung and her right index finger was amputated mid knuckle. Police retrieved the handgun and an AR-15 rifle from Duea\u2019s apartment.\n\nA hearing is scheduled for Feb. 7, 2014.\n\nMpls/FBI gang investigation of north Minneapolis street gangs continues\n\nSince 2010, Minneapolis police\u2019s Violent Offenders Task Force (VOTF), as a part of the FBI\u2019s Safe Streets task force, has used confidential reliable informants (CRIs), undercover officers and surveillance to monitor the activities of known and suspected gang members and associates.\n\nAccording to court documents filed in Hennepin County District Court, investigators say there is ongoing violence between members of the 1-9 Dipset gang and the Taliban.\n\nThe Taliban is allied with YNT \u2014 Young N Thuggin. Investigators also say YNT is loosely organized and does not appear to have a strict hierarchical structure. And they say YNT members mainly sell weed, coke and crack on the street corners of north Minneapolis. But investigators say lately, gang members have been making fake prescriptions for Oxycodone and selling the pills on the street.\n\nPolice also say these gangs are responsible for numerous shootings and murders in north Minneapolis.\n\nOn Dec. 17, the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office announced charges against four people affiliated with the 1-9 Dipset gang. According to the charges, the defendants were stocking up on weapons and ammunition to use in retaliation for the shooting death of one of their members, Tyrone Washington, 27.\n\nWashington was shot and killed at the Epic Nightclub in downtown Minneapolis on Nov. 3.\n\nMinneapolis city gun charges 2013\n\nThe city of Minneapolis charges misdemeanor gun cases. The city attorney prosecutes people for charges such as carrying a gun without a permit, or intoxication while carrying a gun. City attorney Susan Segal sent me these numbers:\n\nThe city charged 82 cases.\n\n73 gross misdemeanors:\n\n51 \u2013 carrying a pistol w/o a permit\n\n21 \u2013 carrying a rifle, BB gun or shotgun in public\n\n1 \u2013 negligent storage\n\n9 misdemeanors:\n\n1 \u2013 discharge of a dangerous weapon\n\n4 \u2013 replica firearm\n\n4 \u2013 carrying under the influence\n\nThe city has closed out 54 of these cases with an overall conviction rate of 81 percent (44 convictions), including 37 gross misdemeanor convictions (79 percent conviction rate) and 7 misdemeanors (100 percent conviction rate).\n\nTen cases were dismissed. Seven cases are pending.\n\nEpilogue\n\nTwo men charged with gun crimes in 2013 have been charged again this year.\n\nOn Jan. 15, 2013, Nathan Sims Jr., was charged with illegal possession of a firearm, actually a BB gun. He pleaded guilty and received three years probation. On Jan. 14, 2014, Sims was allegedly caught again with a firearm \u2014 this time a sawed-off shotgun. He was charged with \u201cprohibited person in possession of a firearm.\u201d\n\nLast year, the county dropped gun charges against Bernard Miles Jr. In a court document, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman wrote his office was dropping the charges because it was, \u201cunable to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt as a result of the court\u2019s order dated 10/2/2013 suppressing necessary evidence.\u201d\n\nThat court order suppressed evidence of a gun found in the trunk of a car Miles was riding in.\n\nOn Jan. 13, 2014, Miles was arrested after police found a loaded .380-caliber pistol in the snow near a car he had been traveling in. He was charged with \u201caiding and abetting prohibited person in possession of a firearm.\u201d", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Police are investigating a shooting that happened during a home invasion Wednesday night, and a source close to the victim says he was shot four times.\n\nFriends say the man who was shot inside his home in the College View Apartments on East Tenth Street has undergone surgery since being rushed to Vidant Medical Center.

A man was shot in the head and died at a hospital a short time later, police said.\n\nAt 11:15 p.m., police were dispatched to a shooting in the 3900 block of Edgewood Road in the East Arlington neighborhood. The victim had been shot several times and died at a hospital before midnight, police said. Police did not identify either of the victims or provide a possible motive.\n\nThe incidents capped a weekend that saw eight people shot across the city, three of them fatally. Among the victims was 28-year-old Ricky Mellerson, who was found shot early Saturday in a vehicle that flipped over while traveling through Mount Vernon on East Madison Street.\n\nPolice confirmed Monday that Mellerson was leaving the Casablanca Hookah Lounge in the 800 block of Guilford Ave. when the shooting occurred and that a female passenger was in the overturned vehicle.

Russell, 23 guilty of the first-degree murder of Hussein Saghir, who was shot outside his Bensenville tobacco store on the evening of Jan 19, 2014. Russell was also found guilty of attempted armed robbery.\n\nAuthorities say Saghir, 36, a Lebanese immigrant, had stood outside the store blocking the entrance to protect his brother and three-year-old nephew who were inside. The shooting was captured on security camera and was played several times at trial.\n\nSaghir was murdered on his wife\u2019s 40th birthday, and had plans to celebrate that night at a family dinner, his widow, Hanan Faraj, testified Tuesday.\n\nRussell testified Thursday that he was at his family\u2019s apartment on West Armitage at the time, an alibi that was attested to by his mother and sister, but did not convince jurors.\n\nDuring the trial, which began Tuesday, two hold-up accomplices who were fellow gang members of Russell identified him as the shooter. The reliability of their testimony was a focal point during closing arguments.\n\nDefense attorney Roger Malavia argued that alleged accomplice Tremayne Davis shot Saghir. Security video showed the gunman in a distinctive maroon hooded sweatshirt, which Davis admitted was his. However, he said Russell donned it to commit the robbery with accomplice Kenneth Bardlett, while Davis sat in the getaway vehicle behind Sam\u2019s Tobacco on Irving Park Road.\n\nMalavia said it was \u201cstunningly obvious\u201d that Davis, who made a plea deal to testify, lied in court. The defense attorney also had harsh words for Bardlett. He had a plea deal to testify, but had to be brought forcibly to court and then refused to answer prosecution questions.\n\nThe defense attorney derisively called Bardlett the prosecution\u2019s star witness, in reference to Bardlett\u2019s facial tattoo of a star. He contrasted them with Russell\u2019s mother and sister, a student at the University of Iowa.\n\n\u201cOur witnesses \u2013 we don\u2019t have anyone to apologize for,\u201d Malavia told jurors.\n\nAssistant State\u2019s Atty. Mike Pawl said Bardlett\u2019s courtroom antics were calculated to show gang members he wasn\u2019t a \u201csnitch.\u201d The prosecutor urged jurors instead to rely on videotaped interviews Bardlett gave to police after his arrest in February 2014, in which he supplied details about the incident that police were able to corroborate.\n\n\u201cThe Bardlett of two and a half years ago is the truthful Bardlett,\u201d Pawl said.\n\nDavis\u2019 account of the sweatshirt was accurate, Pawl said, and noted a gas station security video taken of Davis about 20 minutes before the shooting. The pants and shoes Davis was wearing at the gas station didn\u2019t match those worn by the gunman, Pawl said.\n\nRussell made a statement to police at the time of his arrest, in which he said he knew that hanging out with the wrong crowd would get him in trouble, and that he would only shoot someone in self-defense, the prosecutor noted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a confession to the murder, and it tells you that Hussein Saghir was murdered for absolutely nothing,\u201d Pawl said.\n\nRussell is due back in the courtroom of Judge Daniel Guerin, who presided over the trial, on Dec. 16. A date for sentencing may be set at that hearing.\n\nClifford Ward is a freelance reporter.", "publish_date": "2016-11-18"}, {"text": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Kirk\n\n\n\nIts funny how everyone wants to blame everyone except the people actually involved. These shootings that have been happening are all gang related. If you're a parent of one of these delinquents then you should know whether or not your child is in a gang. And if you dont then you're not doing your job. If they're living in your house which most of them probably are, then there should be no privacy. if you find guns, drugs or colors in their room then you need to act. if not, you're just as guilty when they pull the trigger or get shot because they were wearing the wrong color or the drug deal goes south. And to all the people that know who is in a gang and dont report them, youre just as guilty. Gangs breed violence and crime. Nothing good comes of them and if you're in one then you're an idiot. If you want power and respect and a sense of pride, join the military, learn a trade. And if you really want to shoot someone then go infantry or marines. Law enforcement cant do it on their own. Ignorance, Fear and silence have a strangle hold on this community and it will ultimately rip us apart.\n\n\n\nPosted: Tuesday, April 9, 2013\n\nArticle comment by: Crystal Hawkins\n\n\n\nFirst, I would like to say SORRY to families that have lost a loved on to this foolishness. I am a single parent of two teenagers (boy and girl). I try my very best to instill positive values that were taught to me by my grandparents, parents and numerous others. But, society today as a whole, has changed altogether. Yes, we say that we need role models and more people getting involved with the lives of theses children and I totally agree. Now, you have some parents that try to be their child's friend rather than raise them. I do believe that there should be a bond between you and your children, but define your boundaries. Don't uphold your children in their wrong doings, chastise them. Make it a priority to read and understand the Bible (ex. GOING TO CHURCH), have a family sit down meal, doing family outings, and pray together. Provide positive results is all that I am saying. Do not let them raise you!!!!! I remember when I was younger, if I even looked like I wanted to step out of line with my parents or grandparents, I would get dealt with then (and it was not a time out or punishment). Now, some of these parents do not want you to say anything to their children. If you do, then you are wrong. So, in my opinion only, this is what the result will be. Without GOD in our lives daily, we will never make it in this world.

I am driving directions almost every single hour,\u201d he told reporters at his first formal briefing since the crime wave began.\n\nWhen the shooting spree started on Friday night, he said his chief field commander was giving him constant updates, \u201cand I was giving him directions every single hour this weekend, so I was aware\u201d of the violence.\n\n\u201cAll weekend,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe knew what was taking place. We were trying to get in front of it very quickly.\u201d\n\nWhere he faulted the department \u2013 and himself \u2013 was on public relations.\n\n\u201cOur messaging this weekend was terrible. We should have been in front of you, telling exactly what was going on.\u201d\n\nToday he revealed that he had reassigned the department\u2019s chief spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, to a community partnership office following Guglielmi comment on Monday that \u201call in all, we\u2019re pretty satisfied with the way the city is headed, violence-wise.\u201d\n\nIllegal Guns a Topic in Las Vegas\n\nMayor Rawlings-Blake seized upon the issue of illegal guns when discussing the crime spree, noting that this matter was vigorously addressed at a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting she attended over the weekend in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cI want to again emphasize the importance of stopping the flow of illegal guns into America\u2019s cities,\u201d she said today in prepared remarks. \u201cWe only have one gun store in the city of Baltimore, so it\u2019s clear that not enough is being done to disrupt the pipeline of illegal guns into Baltimore and other cities. In the past few days I met with my fellow mayors from across the county and this issue was front and center to all of us.\u201d\n\nAddressing the murders that took place during her absence, the mayor said, \u201cI have to share with you really how angry I am and concerned about what happened over the weekend \u2013 two dozen shootings, several of them fatal. And I say angry but it\u2019s such a mix of emotions. It\u2019s angry, it\u2019s frustrated, it\u2019s extreme sadness, particularly when we look at the fact that it is not outside invaders killing members of our community, it\u2019s us killing us.\u201d\n\nShe continued in her prepared remarks, \u201cIt was a terrible display of ugly and senseless violence. We know that those who perpetrate those acts [have] power to disgrace our communities and city. We got to do everything to apprehend them and bring them to justice.\n\n\u201cReducing violence,\u201d she added, \u201cis the No. 1 priority of my administration. I will not be satisfied until Baltimore becomes one of the safest big cities in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou Don\u2019t Understand My Outrage\u201d\n\n\n\nStepping to the dais after the mayor, Chief Batts said that news reports often refer to the number of murder victims. \u201cThese are not numbers. These are human beings.\u201d\n\nReferring to Donyae Jones, an African-American woman who was killed early Saturday morning on the 700 block of North Kenwood Avenue, Batts said, \u201cI look at this little 18-year-old girl who was lost this weekend on Kenwood. I look as I go out on the streets at the McCulloh Homes yesterday, where some kids were out, but some gang members fired shots out there, putting at risk those young kids. And I talked to mothers who were out there. Outrage? You don\u2019t understand my outrage about those circumstances. I\u2019ve made it very clear to my staff, I made it very clear to our organization, that we will respond, certainly.\u201d\n\nBatts said the Kenwood Avenue shootings, which left four people shot in addition to Jones, were related to gang rivalries. He said three gangs, the Bloods, Black Guerrilla Family and DJ Boys, \u201ca new crew,\u201d were fighting for territory.\n\nDeputy Police Commissioner John Skinner said that \u201ca tremendous amount of information\u201d has been coming from the community in the wake of the shootings.

They were later released without charges.\n\nStephanie Morris said she has often noticed increased patrolling in the area by school police. She recently questioned one of the officers.\n\n\"He said, 'Ma'am, there are a lot of fights as soon as school gets out,' \" Morris said. \"It seems like it's a big problem.\"\n\n'It's madness'\n\nNewby said local authorities are doing their best.\n\n\"Every time we heard there is a large group of juveniles out here, we come out, break them up and move them along,\" he said.\n\nDeputies have not found the pistol used in the fight.\n\nWatching the wounded teen on the ground made Arnold recall his own past quarrels in high school.\n\n\"In the old days, you'd just fight then shake hands and go home,\" he said. \"Now they're shooting each other.

Now about two weeks later, she fears her daughter has been forgotten.\n\n\u201cI have done everything in my power to keep my kids safe,\u201d said Stingley, a single mother who also has two sons, 6 and 18. \u201cThis is the one time I couldn\u2019t. I just want to know why. What happened to my baby?\u201d\n\nPolice reported no arrests as of Wednesday and could provide no description of the shooter, except that he fled in a black SUV after opening fire at another car about 2:30 a.m. on June 25 at a stoplight at 73rd Street and King Drive.\n\nMarissa Boyd-Stingley was one of five passengers inside that other car. She was shot in the head, and another woman, a neighbor, was wounded in the hand. Three men, one age 18 and two age 20, were also shot: One in the chest, one in the shoulder, and the other in the hand, police said. Boyd-Stingley was the only one who died.\n\nNortasha Stingley said she had felt something wasn't right that night and had called her daughter early that morning, worried.\n\n\u201cI woke up and sat straight up in my bed and called her,\u201d she said. It was shortly before 1 a.m. \u201cI asked her where she was and told her I loved her and to be careful. God woke me up to tell my baby I love her one last time and I thank him for that.\u201d\n\nAbout two hours later, Stingley heard banging on her first-floor window and rushed to the door, thinking it was her daughter. But it was her neighbor saying her daughter had been shot.\n\nThe next moments are a blur to Stingley. She remembers cursing and crying and finally screaming for the neighbor to leave her house. She could only think of what more she could have done to save her daughter.\n\nEarlier this year, her daughter had come home from Central State University in Ohio, concerned about her mother's health after an accident. Stingley had fallen down and was knocked unconscious, cracking her front teeth, she said.\n\nWhile Stingley underwent medical tests, her daughter cared for her 6-year-old brother Levell. Still, Stingley said she did not feel at ease with her daughter\u2019s decision to come home.\n\n\u201cMy chest was heavy and I didn\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the company she was keeping. Something just didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d\n\nShe worried about a young man Marissa had met -- a man who was in the car when the shots were fired. Neighbors had warned Stingley about the man, telling her he was \u201cno good,\u201d she said. The man and her daughter, along with other friends, had been at the lake on the day of the shooting and were on their way home.\n\nNone of the people who were with her daughter that night has contacted her to share information about what led up to the shooting, Stingley said.\n\n\u201cI want the people in the car to sit down with me and the police. I want to know what happened that night,\u201d Stingley said. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the mayor, the governor, the first lady coming to my house for my baby? She was good, she wasn\u2019t a criminal. She was a student. Why doesn\u2019t anyone care?\n\n\u201cI laid a foundation of morals, respect and decency for my kids,\u201d Stingley said as she sat in her living room next to her daughter\u2019s high school diploma. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s only mistake was going out that night with possibly the wrong people. Did she deserve to die because of that mistake?\n\n\u201cThis hole in my heart is where my daughter used to be. I have to be strong, but things will never be the same.\"\n\nStingley busies herself with her two other children, Levell and Thomas, 18.\n\nLevell, at 6, doesn\u2019t quite understand that his big sister is gone. \u201cMarissa ran away,\u201d he said. \u201cI miss her. ...

Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio, today announced that 18 alleged members of No Love City, a subset of the violent Folk Nation street gang, have been variously charged in a 76-count indictment with conspiracy to commit murder, weapons possession and other charges for multiple shootings throughout Brooklyn, including one that left a 25-year-old man dead and another that left a 60-year-old innocent woman paralyzed.\n\nThe District Attorney said that, according to the investigation, the defendants, whose ages range from 18 to 27 years old, are members of No Love City (NLC), a subset of Folk Nation, and operate primarily within the confines of the 63rd, 67th, 69th and 70th precincts, mostly in the vicinity of Flatbush Avenue, Newkirk Avenue and Ditmas Avenue in Brooklyn. During the course of the conspiracy the defendants variously allegedly agreed to commit crimes, including murder and assault, in order to maintain their dominance over that geographic area, particularly Flatbush.\n\nFurthermore, the defendants also allegedly directed their acts of violence toward rival gang members living in and around Canarsie, Brooklyn, including members of the Crips subsets 100 Cloccs and GS9, as well as HQ Monopoly and the 1090s, in retaliation for the murder of NLC member Malik Bhola, 17, aka, Reckless, on January 1, 2014, in Bushwick. Bhola was shot in the chest following a fight over a girl at a party he had attended. Before he was shot he sent out a call for help \u2013 noting that there were \u201copps\u201d in the area, referring to opposition members of gangs from Canarsie, also known as the \u201cFlossy\u201d in gang parlance.\n\nThe District Attorney said that, according to the investigation, following the murder of Bhola, members of NLC, including some of the defendants, would go \u201criding out\u201d in Canarsie, by which they meant going on hunting expeditions in vehicles and shooting individuals they suspected of being 100 Cloccs or HQ Monopoly, or merely being from the \u201cFlossy.\u201d\n\nDuring the escalating violence, it is alleged, NLC members frequently discussed their intentions and efforts to engage in additional attacks and took credit for past attacks using social media. The violent attacks on their Canarsie rivals escalated further following the October 14, 2015, murder of NLC member Richard James, aka, \u201cMoney Bags.\u201d James was shot to death outside the Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California.\n\nIt is alleged that during the conspiracy charged in the indictment, which is from September 27, 2013 until January 25, 2016, to further the criminal activities of the gang, NLC members committed various other crimes including selling prison contraband and robberies. They also communicated their intentions on social media, including Facebook, and during inmate calls made from Rikers Island, including ordering acts of retribution such as beatings and shootings of members of rival gangs.

Brown, 17, on Wednesday, May 21, appeared in Bay County Circuit Court and pleaded no contest to armed robbery and third-degree criminal sexual conduct. In exchange for his pleas, the prosecution agreed to dismiss two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and single counts of larceny in a building, first-degree home invasion, felony firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon.\n\nA no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for the purposes of sentencing.\n\nOne of Brown's codefendants, 20-year-old Sammie L. Wright III, followed his friend's lead and on Thursday, May 29, also pleaded no contest to armed robbery in exchange for the dismissal of larceny in a building, first-degree home invasion, felony firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon.\n\nArmed robbery is a life offense.\n\nIn Cobbs hearings for each man, Bay County Chief Circuit Judge Kenneth W. Schmidt indicated their minimum sentence would not exceed 12 years in prison.\n\nThe pair's codefendants \u2014 Nashawn D. Lane, 18, and Antonio D. Griffin, 19 \u2014 are scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday, June 3. Schmidt is presiding. Each of them is charged with armed robbery, first-degree home invasion, larceny in a building, assault with a dangerous weapon and felony firearm.\n\nProsecutors contend the quartet on the evening of Jan. 14 broke into the Bay City apartment of Rufus Smith. A woman who was there at the time testified in a February preliminary examination that four to six masked and armed men barged into the residence. She said one of the men, whom she identified as Brown, took her into a bathroom and raped her.\n\nThe woman said she was at Smith's place to buy marijuana, but hadn't actually made the purchase when the intruders arrived.\n\nSmith testified in the same hearing that the invaders demanded drugs and money, but he managed to break away from them and flee outside. He said he ran to a neighbor's house to call 911 and did not know the woman was still inside.\n\nSmith said he later discovered two TVs, two watches, cologne, marijuana, prescription medicine and cash were missing.\n\nProsecutors also allege that three days later, on the evening of Jan. 17, the men accosted Lori Davis as she backed her car out of her Bay City driveway. Davis testified in a March continuation of the preliminary examination that two of the men approached her car and asked for directions, then one pulled a long gun.\n\nDavis said she laid on her car horn and the man took off on foot.\n\nPolice arrested all four men that same night, after officers observed them exiting an area house. Bay City Public Safety Detective Nate Kamp testified in March that in subsequent interviews, each defendant said he was at Smith's home on Jan. 14, and that Brown said he had some sexual contact with a woman there.\n\nSchmidt is to sentence Brown at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, July 7, and Wright at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, July 21.", "publish_date": "2014-05-30"}, {"text": "Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service.\n\nRe-enter zip code or sign up for digital access.\n\nGet digital access", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "For over a decade Topix has proudly served up your town's latest news and hottest takes.

Plenty, say Second Amendment advocates.\n\nUkraine, a nation of 45 million people, has restrictive laws governing private gun ownership. The government is in possession of more than seven million guns, while three million weapons, both legal and illicit, are in the hands of private citizens, creating a staggering gulf in firepower. By comparison, in the United States, there are 310 million guns in private hands, with only 3.85 million possessed by the military and police forces.\n\nThis fuels a longstanding argument held by gun rights advocates, that the government should not have a monopoly on the country\u2019s firearms. As largely unarmed Ukrainian protestors face off against a military armed with the world\u2019s sixth-largest inventory of small arms, American supporters of the right to bear arms are decrying restrictive gun laws both here and in Ukraine\u2014and in Venezuela, where citizens are demanding better security and protected freedom of speech. Three people have been killed there in recent weeks.\n\nThese convulsions of violence against protesters have prompted gun-rights advocates to think about taking Second Amendment protections on the road.
