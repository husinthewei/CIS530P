The woman and her husband are speaking out as police search for the suspect. Police are searching for a man accused of breaking into a vehicle, entering a family\u2019s garage and then opening fire at a homeowner after she confronted him. The ordeal began shortly after 7 a.m. Sunday at a home on Madison Avenue in the Fort Washington section of Upper Dublin Township. Police say the man entered an unlocked vehicle in the driveway, found a garage door opener inside and then used it to enter the garage. The homeowner, Melissa Malloy, told NBC10 she first spotted the suspect in a black Ford Expedition outside her house but figured he was lost and needed directions. She became suspicious when she heard her garage door opening. When she went to investigate she saw the suspect inside her garage. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cI was really curious. What are you doing here? And who do you think you are? And he didn\u2019t respond at all.\u201d Malloy chased the man out of the garage. Realizing the danger, she turned around. That\u2019s when the man pulled out a gun and fired one shot. Fortunately for Malloy, she wasn\u2019t struck. The man went into his vehicle and fled the scene. \u201cI remember hearing the shot and thinking, that sounded exactly like a gunshot but it\u2019s Sunday morning, in Upper Dublin,\u201d Melissa\u2019s husband Chris Malloy told NBC10. Neither Melissa, Chris nor their three children were injured during the incident. \u201cHe dropped it all in the driveway on his way out to his car and there was a shell casing on the road,\u201d Chris Malloy said. The scary moment for the family comes as Chris continues to recover from a cancer battle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lock our doors,\u201d Melissa Malloy said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure our car doors are locked and we\u2019re just going to carry on.\u201d Police described the suspect as a \u201cheavy-set male\u201d but did not release further description.

The incident happened at 4500 SW 71st Avenue about 12:30 p.m. Police said 45-year-old Freddy Saladriga confronted the owner of the business, Evelio Cobas, regarding a vehicle repair issue. That argument escalated into an argument, leading to Saladriga stabbing Cobas multiple times. Another customer, Alberto Benito-Budincevich, attempted to intervene, but was also stabbed by Saladriga. That customer then pulled out a gun and shot Saladriga in the lower half of his body. \"At this time, it's too soon to tell if it was a targeted thing or if it's a dispute that just escalated,\" said police spokeswoman Detective Elena Hernandez. \"As far as we know right now, it was a dispute over repairs to the subject's vehicle.\" Saladriga was taken to the hospital for treatment, then released to police custody. Cobas and Benito-Budincevich were treated at the body shop. Court records say Saladriga was arrested on battery charges about a year ago. Copyright 2014 by Local10.com. All rights reserved.

Shortly after 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Marysville police were called to a report of an assault in the 10500 block of 56th Drive Northeast. While on their way, the officers were told that the two suspects, a man and a woman, were no longer inside the home. When police arrived, they saw that a man had been tackled and was being held down by one of the victims. The man was taken into custody. Officers said the two suspects, a 42-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman, both Arlington residents, had gone to the home believing stolen property belonging to a third party was inside. Investigators said the two forced their way into the house brandishing handguns. Officers said the woman pointed her handgun directly at one of the four people inside, threatening to kill him if they didn\u2019t get what they were looking for. One of the men who was being held at gunpoint grabbed the handgun away from the woman, while a female resident ran into a bedroom down a hallway. A second male resident began scuffling with the armed man in an attempt to get his gun. The scuffle between the two went to the ground and the woman who had run into a bedroom emerged and sprayed the intruder with a can of bear mace. After the intruder had been sprayed, one of the residents was able to take the gun from him. Both intruders fled the house, but because the man had been sprayed with mace, he was unable to get far before he was tackled by one of the victims as officers arrived. Less than an hour later, the other intruder called 911 to tell officers where she was and turn herself in. She was taken into custody about six blocks away from the home. Officers said they did not recover any stolen property at the home and none was believed to have been there.

Plenty, say Second Amendment advocates. Ukraine, a nation of 45 million people, has restrictive laws governing private gun ownership. The government is in possession of more than seven million guns, while three million weapons, both legal and illicit, are in the hands of private citizens, creating a staggering gulf in firepower. By comparison, in the United States, there are 310 million guns in private hands, with only 3.85 million possessed by the military and police forces. This fuels a longstanding argument held by gun rights advocates, that the government should not have a monopoly on the country\u2019s firearms. As largely unarmed Ukrainian protestors face off against a military armed with the world\u2019s sixth-largest inventory of small arms, American supporters of the right to bear arms are decrying restrictive gun laws both here and in Ukraine\u2014and in Venezuela, where citizens are demanding better security and protected freedom of speech. Three people have been killed there in recent weeks. These convulsions of violence against protesters have prompted gun-rights advocates to think about taking Second Amendment protections on the road. Gun Owners of America, a gun-rights organization even more extreme than the N.R.A., has already worked with foreign politicians seeking to increase the availability of firearms in Central America. \u201cWe don\u2019t support arming people to carry out their complaints, but we\u2019re seeing more and more nations, like North Korea, annihilating gun rights as a way of furthering their tyranny,\u201d Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, told the Daily Beast. North Korea was cited this week by the United Nations for its campaign of imprisonment, torture and rape. GunPolicy.org points out that there are more than 875 million firearms in the world, with 75 percent of those in the hands of civilians. Each year about 10 to 15 billion rounds of ammunition are manufactured, enough bullets to shoot every person in the world twice. United States citizens are in possession of a third of the world\u2019s guns.

Two armed robbers, one with an assault style rifle, burst in looking for money around 10:30 p.m. Sunday. \u201cTwo masked, disguised suspects, who were also armed, walked into the business, they ordered all of the customers to put their hands on the tables and not to move, they then went to each employee and asked them not only to escort them to the safe, but to open the registers,\u201d explained Fort Lauderdale Police Department spokeswoman Deanna Greenlaw.

(Courtesy of Ypsilanti police) Antoine Jones Four teenagers were arraigned Friday on felony charges stemming from a pistol-whipping and attempted car-jacking incident involving an Eastern Michigan University student, according to Court records. Three teens are juveniles, but all were charged as adults in the 14A-1 District Court. Antoine Jones, 17; Zekai Ewing, 16; Ondavius Alexander, 16; and James Morgan, 15, all of Ypsilanti Township, were each charged with counts of carjacking, armed robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the records indicate. In the eyes of the law, 17-year-olds are considered adults. Carjacking is a felony punishable by life in prison. Morgan's attorney, Michael Vincent, contacted The Ann Arbor News Friday after the arraignment to say there is scientific evidence 15-year-olds like his client don't have the same minds as adults. \"Our office is preparing a defense to the charges,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWhatever involvement, if any, was minimal for Mr. Mogan.\" Police say around 9 p.m. Jan. 21 the four teens followed the EMU student from a downtown Ypsilanti restaurant where the security camera images were captured to where the student's car was parked a few blocks away in the 700 block of Congress Street near Summit. The student, a 19-year-old South Lyon man, got into his vehicle, which was soon surrounded by the four suspects who ordered him out at gunpoint, police said. According to the victim, two of the suspects were armed. One of the armed suspects hit the EMU student with the handgun causing a cut over his eye, police said. The four suspects attempted to carjack the student, but were thwarted because the Sreett was too icy and they couldn't get the car moving, according to police. The student fled through backyards in the neighborhood, only to be caught by the suspects, who stole his wallet. Police released security camera images of the suspects to the Ann Arbor News and received numerous tips. Two of the suspects were located and arrested. The other two turned themselves in. All four teens are being held on $50,000 cash bond. Jones is being held in the Washtenaw County Jail. The three other teens are being held in the Juvenile Detention. A preliminary examination is set in the case for Feb. 6. Ewing, Jones and Alexander were appointed attorneys. Morgan retained Vincent.

The man was taken to MetroHealth Hospital and is in critical condition, police said. A news release says the man was inside his apartment Sunday in the 3900 block of Bluestone Road when the shooting occurred. A South Euclid man, Alexander F. Royes Jr., 40, was charged Monday in Cleveland Heights Municipal Court with second-degree felony assault in connection with the shooting, Court records say. A warrant was issued for Royes' arrest. Police said there were drugs and drug paraphernalia found inside the 27-year-old man's apartment. There were three other reports of armed robberies in the city over the weekend: one report of someone trying to rob a 17-year-old at gunpoint and a report of several shots being fired. One of the incidents included the severe beating of a 41-year-old woman coming home from work at a Brecksville retirement home around 1 a.m. Saturday. The woman, reports say, suffered a perforated eardrum, head trauma and a swollen eye after three men attacked her as she tried to open the door to her home. Reports say she walked to her Elbon Road home after taking the bus. While walking toward her home, she saw the men crossing the street. The woman walked up her driveway and reported being struck in the ear from behind. Reports say the woman told police it sounded \"like a bomb went off in her head,\" reports say. One of the men grabbed her backpack, while the others punched and kicked her in the head and chest several times, reports say. The men stole the backpack that had the woman's work identification card, leftovers from lunch, umbrella and her debit card. The woman told police she canceled the card and no one tried to use it between the time it was taken and the time she canceled the account.

At about 10:10 p.m., deputies responded to the 4800 block of 18th Street West in Bradenton to follow-up with Theresa Tucker, who previously reported a vehicle burglary. Deputies saw Guadarrama and Tucker inside a vehicle in the driveway with what looked like prescription pills and marijuana. Deputies ordered Tucker to step out of the vehicle, then asked Guadarrama to remain inside until backup arrived, Dave Bristow, agency spokesman, said. That's when Guadarrama took off. He ran down the Sreett and through yards. At one point, he was running toward the back-up deputies, who began chasing him. Deputies heard a gunshot and continued the pursuit. While standing between two homes in the 4800 block of 19th Street West, Guadarrama reportedly dropped his gun, picked it back up, then fired two shots at deputies who took cover, Bristow said.

Civilians didn't get hurt,\" Bristow said. \"That could've been a bad situation if he had run into a house and started holding people.\" Deputies reportedly found crack cocaine, prescription pills and marijuana in the vehicle driven by Guadarrama. He also had a bag of crack cocaine in his pants pocket, authorities said. Tucker has not been charged. Guadarrama was a 2009 Bayshore High School graduate.

Hayward police were called to the Summerwood Apartment Homes at 21701 Foothill Boulevard around 7:15 p.m. after Pleasanton police requested a welfare check on a woman living there, Hayward police Sgt. Eric Melendez said. The woman had made several 911 calls to the Pleasanton police dispatch center, prompting the request, Melendez said. Two officers made contact with the woman Tuesday night and were talking to her when police say she displayed a handgun in a threatening manner. Police then retreated to the parking lot of the complex while giving commands for the woman to drop the gun, Melendez said. When the woman refused to drop the weapon, one officer fired four to five shots, Melendez said. That prompted the woman to stagger, fall and roll down the stairs from her second-story apartment. The officer who fired was not identified but is a young officer who has been on the force for one year, police said. Officials did not say how many shots hit the woman or where she was struck. Emergency personnel were called, and the woman was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where she died from her injuries. Both police officers have been put on administrative leave. It wasn\u2019t the first time police had come to the apartment. On Jan. 24, undercover officers from the Pleasanton Police Department served a search warrant at the Hayward apartment and found guns, drugs and other contraband, said Pleasanton police Sgt.

The first, a 16-year-old boy, was shot in the leg just after midnight on Saturday morning in the 3300 block of W. Baltimore St., in the city\u2019s Saint Joseph\u2019s neighborhood. The two others, a 15-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man, were shot about 4:44 p.m. Saturday near the intersection of Edmondson Avenue and Allendale Street, just to the north in the city\u2019s Edgewood neighborhood. Police announced both shootings over the weekend but did not disclose the age of the victims in the double shooting until The Baltimore Sun requested them on Monday. One of the teens had been shot in the chest, and the other in the neck, though police said they didn\u2019t know Monday which teen had been more critically injured. Police said the 15-year-old boy was talking at the scene, outside the City Mart corner convenience store. The 18-year-old was unresponsive but later was revived and speaking as well. Both were taken to an area hospital, stabilized and expected to survive. The 16-year-old boy from the morning shooting also was expected to survive. Police don\u2019t identify the victims of non-fatal shootings. The shootings were both in the Southwest District, the latest in a pocket of West and Southwest Baltimore that has undergone a large number of shootings in recent weeks. In between the bursts of gunfire in Baltimore on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 many of them teens \u2014 had traveled to Washington for the youth-organized March For Our Lives rally against gun violence. The rally was organized after 17 students and faculty were killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month. Mayor Catherine E. Pugh\u2019s administration helped organize 61 privately funded buses to take Baltimore youths to the rally. On Monday, her office said more than 2,700 students went to Washington on the buses, along with many chaperones. A final, official count was not available yet. Among the Baltimore attendees were 17 from West Baltimore\u2019s Excel Academy, which has lost seven students to gun violence since last school year. Pugh said Monday that the teens\u2019 shootings in Baltimore the same day as the rally were a good example of why the voices of Baltimore\u2019s youth were needed in Washington, and why she felt compelled to organize the buses. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted our young people\u2019s voices to be heard, because urban America faces these sort of tragedies often,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are too many guns on our streets, too many illegal guns on the streets of Baltimore.\u201d At the march, the Excel students had turned many heads with a sign bearing the images of some of their slain classmates and another that read, \u201cIn one school year, we lost 7 of our children to gun violence.\u201d In addition to the three teens shot Saturday, at least three other teens have been shot in Baltimore this month \u2014 two of them in the same general area as the weekend violence. One 17-year-old boy was shot in the back last Tuesday morning in the 2500 block of Emerson St., in the city\u2019s Shipley Hill neighborhood, just to the east of the Saint Joseph\u2019s neighborhood. Two 17-year-olds were among 10 people shot the week prior in a burst of gunfire that included two triple shootings. One of the teens was shot on the east side, the other in a triple shooting that also injured a man and a woman in Allendale, just north of Saint Joseph\u2019s. T.J. Smith, a police spokesman, said two weeks ago that there had been \u201cextra deployments placed on the streets in general\u201d and in the area where all the above shootings occurred, but that unfortunately, \u201csome motivated bad guys were able to get through those deployments.\u201d He repeated that message Monday, saying the double shooting Saturday was heard by an officer in the area. \u201cOur officers are in the areas that we\u2019ve seen some of the incidents take Place in, and are getting there quickly, but it\u2019s still happening, so it\u2019s a concern for us,\u201d he said. The fact that three teenagers were shot was particularly of concern, he said. Smith said top commanders were on conference calls over the weekend and in a big meeting Monday afternoon to discuss the violence in the area, and were \u201cadjusting our deployments again.\u201d He said much of the violence in Baltimore is related to \u201cdrugs, gangs and guns,\u201d but no such connections have been determined with the teenagers\u2019 shootings. He said police had few leads in those two incidents in part because \u201cwe weren't able to get any information from any of those injured about who could have done it.\u201d Pugh said her administration is doing everything it can to get teens employed, or into programs where they can be productive intellectually, athletically or artistically, before drug dealers recruit them into the drug trade and thus the path of bullets. \u201cWhat we want to do is make sure we are in front of our children before the drug dealers are in front of them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wrap our arms around our children. We have to get to them before the drug dealers get to them.\u201d Police ask anyone with information on the weekend shootings to call detectives at 410-396-2221 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-7-LOCK-UP.

Joseph Anderson, who was home on leave for the holidays on New Year's Day, when he was shot dead outside his former in-laws' home in Marrero. Darwin \"Trent\" Bethune, 24, of 3366 Rosemont Drive in eastern New Orleans, will be tried on the charge of second-degree murder during the week of Nov. 3. A Jefferson Parish grand jury handed up an indictment last week charging him in Anderson's death. The trial date was announced Friday, during a status hearing in 24th Judicial District Judge Robert Pitre's court. Bethune, one of numerous inmates who appeared in court, said nothing during the brief hearing. He's due back in Court next month. Anderson, 31, an animal-care specialist who had served two tours in Iraq and one in Kuwait, was dropping off his three children, ages 7, 11 and 12, at their grandparents' home in the 6100 block of Ray Street, when he was shot in the face in the driveway. He died just hours before he was scheduled to return to his duty station at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. His mother's vehicle, which he was driving, was stolen, leading authorities initially to suspect the soldier was killed during a carjacking. Deputies found it the following day, about two miles away on Rue Louis Street Phillipe in Marrero. However, Court records show a link between the suspect and the soldier. Bethune had been romantically involved with Anderson's former wife, according to a Court stay-away order in which he is identified as her \"current or former dating partner.\" Authorities have not discussed publicly the link in connection with the homicide. Bethune is charged with unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, accused of going into Anderson's ex-wife's home in Harvey without permission on Jan. 5, days after Anderson was killed, Court records show. In connection with his bond in that criminal case, he was barred from being within 300 feet of her, Court records show. Anderson and his wife, who had accused him of abusing her and moved back to Jefferson Parish from Hawaii as a result in 2012, were divorced in September, Court records show. The former couple was granted joint custody of their children in November. The children live with her, but Anderson was to get custody alternatively on major holidays, including New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, according to the custody agreement. About a month after Anderson was killed, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office detectives announced Bethune as their suspect. Bethune turned himself in days later. Bethune would face mandatory life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. He remains jailed in lieu of a $2 million bond. Prosecutors sought the unusually high bond because they say Bethune applied for a passport so he could leave the country. His attorneys will seek a Court order in an attempt to bar prosecutors from presenting some evidence during the trial. The \"suppression hearing\" is set for Sept. 19. Friday's status hearing was housekeeping in nature. Assistant District Attorney Angel Varnado told the judge her office has three boxes of evidence to turn over to Bethune's attorneys, Martin Regan and Aiden Shah.

The dispatcher heard a gunshot over the phone and then the line went dead. The call was made just after 5 p.m. Wednesday, March 14, said Isabella County Sheriff Mike Main. Within minutes, members of a law enforcement tactical team approached the couple's home at 10803 Brinton Road. Through a window, they saw Brad Hatt dead from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound, Main said. They entered the residence and found his wife, 66-year-old Janice Hatt, shot multiple times but still alive in a bedroom, the sheriff said. Janice Hatt was airlifted from the shooting scene to a Grand Rapids-area hospital. Main said she was last listed in critical condition and was under an induced coma. \"What we're getting was it's pretty touch and go,\" for Janice Hatt, he said. The Hatts lived by themselves at their residence in southwestern Isabella County. Nothing there, so far, has pointed investigators to a motive, Main said. \"We're kind of at a blank here,\" the sheriff said. The next steps, Main said, is to interview family and friends and analyze the couple's computers and phones to determine what might have sparked the violent acts. \"I think whatever happened transpired pretty quickly,\" he said. Main said the suspected weapon was a semi-automatic handgun. Neither Hatt has a criminal history, and police have never responded to the home for domestic issues, the sheriff said. The Hatt residence is listed online as the location of The Gardens at Rocky Meadows. The business bills itself as an 80-acre estate available for wedding and party rentals, according to the website.

Devron Devaughn Smith, 30, of Colbert, would not tell medical staff where and how he got shot when he showed up early Tuesday at Street Mary\u2019s Hospital, according to police. All they knew was that Smith had been shot in the upper left arm, police said. Police did not have much more success in determining what happened because Smith told them he did not want to talk about it. Smith would only tell them he had been shot four days earlier, police said. While at the hospital, officers were informed by a 911 dispatcher that a warrant was on file with the Clarke Country Sheriff\u2019s Office charging Smith with a felony probation violation. The violation stemmed from the man\u2019s conviction on a robbery charge in 2016 for which he was sentenced to 15 months in confinement, 15 years on probation and was banished from Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties, according to Clarke County Superior Court records. The conviction stemmed from Smith\u2019s arrest in December 2015 for an alleged home invasion. According to Court records, Smith pleaded guilty to robbery by intimidation and prosecutors dismissed the more serious charges of first-degree home invasion, armed robbery, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In a motion to dismiss the charges, the Western Judicial Circuit stated that while it had sufficient evidence to go to trial, \u201cThere were evidentiary and victim credibility problems that warranted a negotiated resolution\u201d to Smith\u2019s case.

Trooper Mark Peterson stopped to help the woman, identified as Melody Victoria Gray, 30, and her male passenger, Domonique Maurice Crayton, 29, both of Milwaukee, who were in a car that had slid into the median a few miles east of Moorhead, the BCA said. The time was about 10:10 a.m. Monday, Court documents said. The car, which had been westbound before the crash, had come to a stop facing east against the median barrier, the BCA said. Peterson had activated his squad car camera to capture video and audio, Court documents said. He got the driver\u2019s identification (which later proved to be false) and the passenger identified himself as Donald Lamont Echols, Court documents said. The car didn\u2019t have proper plates, so Peterson checked the vehicle identification number. Peterson then returned to his squad car, where the audio was discontinued but the video continued to run, Court documents said. While Peterson worked to verify the information given by the car\u2019s occupants, the passenger and driver appeared to be trying to Drive the car out of the ditch, which was unsuccessful. The trooper then checked the VIN again, while the male passenger sat in the back seat of the car on the driver\u2019s side with the door open, Court documents said. When Peterson learned the car had been reported stolen in Germantown, Wis., he positioned his squad car to prevent the disabled car from driving away. Peterson then asked Crayton to get out of the car, the BCA said. As Peterson tried to handcuff Crayton, Gray got out of the driver\u2019s seat and, with her right arm extended, pointed a 9mm handgun at the trooper\u2019s head and appeared to pull the trigger, Court documents said. The gun, however, did not fire. The trooper then pulled himself and Crayton away toward the back of the car, and put Crayton to the ground, Court documents said. Meanwhile, the woman tried to manipulate the handgun to chamber a round and raised the gun again toward the trooper. The trooper then fired his weapon and hit her in the right arm, Court documents said. The woman then dropped the gun, ran across I-94 and north into a field, Court documents and the BCA said. A snowplow clearing the westbound lanes stopped about 50 yards past the incident scene. Trooper Peterson handcuffed Crayton and left him on his stomach behind the car.

An attempt was made to identify the man from fingerprints, but was unsuccessful. Officers then learned that Gray had an active warrant for her arrest out of Wisconsin for kidnapping and being a felon in possession of a firearm, Court documents said. Officers contacted Wisconsin authorities, who provided information on a man connected with Gray.

For the Clay County charges, bail was set at $50,000 cash or bond without conditions, or $30,000 with restrictions on travel and maintaining good behavior.

Someone called the 36-year-old driver around 6 p.m., according to an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department report, asking if he was the \u201cmeat man\u201d and whether he could meet at an apartment complex later in the evening to make a transaction. The man, who works for Farmer\u2019s Finest, agreed and drove to Arborstone Apartments in the 3800 block of Breen Drive, near 38th Street and Post Road. A man approached the driver\u2019s truck, police said, pointed a gun at him and ordered him out. Once out of the truck, the driver saw a second man approaching, he told police. The two men walked the driver to a vacant apartment unit, he said, where they took his cellphone and wallet. Then they tied his hands in front of him with zip ties, the man said, and put him in a closet. Afraid for his life, the man stayed in the closet until well past the time he no longer heard the men\u2019s voices, he told police. Then he left and walked back to his vehicle, he said, where he discovered the men had taken all the meat he was hauling. The driver drove to a different apartment complex, police said, where he spoke with a security officer who called police at 11:52 p.m. A police report lists the value of the meat at $600. The man also was carrying $100 in his wallet, he told police. Descriptions of suspects are vague in the police report. The driver told police he could not recall much detail about anything that occurred because of his discomfort over having the gun pointed at him, police said.

He handed over the cash in his wallet to an armed assailant, he said, but then tried to tackle the man when he realized he was also intent on taking the meat truck. He was fortunate in his own scrape, he said, that a bullet that pierced a section of his back did not hit any vital organs, tendons or bones. Call Star reporter Bill McCleery at (317) 444-6083.
