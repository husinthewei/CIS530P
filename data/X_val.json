At one point his hand reaches down, his right hand behind his back, and then he produces a weapon, brings it up, both hands in a shooting stance parallel to the ground, pointing it at the officer,\" Bruegger said. \"The officer immediately starts firing, and strikes the suspect.\"Police said the officer fired at least six times.Eyewitness News spoke to a 63-year-old man who saw the shooting from his front yard. He says the suspect did shoot at the officer and the officer had to protect himself.\"It's unfortunate the officer is placed in the position but when a suspect points a weapon at the officer, the officer really has no choice but to defend himself,\" said Bruegger.The officer, 40 years old and a 13-year veteran of Pasadena PD, was not hurt.

He's accused of shooting at a 24-year-old woman on Cedar Road.\n\nJames Middleton served 13 years in prison for strangling his live-in girlfriend in 2000.\n\nCLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio \u2014 A 55-year-old man convicted for killing his live-in girlfriend and stuffing her into a trunk in 2000 is facing charges that accuse him of shooting at a 24-year-old woman late Monday.\n\nJames Middleton, of Cleveland Heights, was charged Tuesday in Cleveland Heights Municipal Court with second-degree felonious assault. Bond was set at $20,000 and a preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 25.\n\nMiddleton, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend, a top administrator at the Cuyahoga County Community Mental Health Board, is accused of firing at least one shot at the woman out of the passenger seat of his nephew\u2019s car on Cedar Road.\n\nMiddleton, reports say, is the uncle of the woman\u2019s children and was riding in the passenger seat with the father of the woman\u2019s child. One of the bullets struck the hood of her car, reports say.\n\nThe woman told police she was driving about 11:40 p.m. near Rossmoor Road from a friend\u2019s home, when a dark colored Chevrolet sedan pulled up next to her car. She told police she recognized the driver as Middleton\u2019s 30-year-old nephew, who is the father of her children.\n\nShe told police Middleton stuck a handgun out his window and shot at least one time at her.\n\nThe woman and the 30-year-old man exited their cars and argued in the street, reports say. The woman then drove to the police department. Investigators searched her car and noted the bullet hole.\n\nMiddleton was released from prison Jan. 15, 2013 after serving a 13-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the middle of his trial. In December, Middleton won a pro se appeal in the Eighth District Court of Appeals that allowed him to be released from probation.\n\nHe was originally sentenced to five years on probation following his release, but the common pleas judge sentenced him to \u201cthe maximum allowable\u201d time on probation. The panel of judges ruled the probation portion of his sentence was incorrect because it was too vague.\n\nMiddleton pleaded guilty to strangling Karen Spencer, 42, on Sept. 22, 2000, then stuffing her in the trunk of Spencer\u2019s 1997 Mercedes Benz. Spencer parked the car near Shaker Square and left.\n\nPlain Dealer archives say Middleton killed Spencer after she kicked him out of their home after a nearly 10-year relationship.\n\nSpencer, archives say, was the top administrator for the county\u2019s health board where she made an $81,000 salary. She was the mother of two of Middleton\u2019s children and was an impeccable dresser, which helped detectives at the time see through evidence Middleton tried to plant to make it look like a car jacking.\n\nArchives say she was wearing a blue suit at the time and Middleton put green shoes in the trunk with her. Middleton was also convicted of tampering with evidence in the case. The couple\u2019s children were 4 and 1 years old at the time, archives say.\n\n\"I strangled her,\" Middleton said with his voice cracking during his sentencing hearing, according to a 2001 Plain Dealer story. \"I put her in the trunk,\" he said after a long pause, tears flowing. \"And I took her to Shaker Square. I'm sorry.\"\n\nMiddleton has a history of violence against women. Archives say he was convicted of domestic violence in 1999 when Middleton and Spencer lived in University Heights. Middleton grabbed her, started choking her and slammed her head through a wall.\n\nMiddleton was also arrested in 1997, according to archives, for choking Spencer. He was convicted in 1992 of domestic violence against another woman, who he had a child with, archives say.\n\nFor more crime news, click the button:", "publish_date": "2014-02-12"}, {"text": "NEWARK \u2014 Newark police officers seized a pair of loaded handguns from two convicted felons in the city's Central and West wards, officials said.\n\nDuring a motor vehicle stop conducted around 7 a.m. today on Brunswick Avenue, police found 32-year-old city resident Anibal Santiago was carrying a loaded .380 caliber handgun and drug paraphernalia after officers found he was illegally double parked, said Sgt.
