Six of the first seven victims were also shot to death.\n\nNext, police rushed a 21-year-old man to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after he was shot several times just before 1 a.m. Wednesday on Osage Avenue near 53rd Street in West Philadelphia. The wounded man was listed in critical condition.\n\nPolice said that the victim was shot multiple times on the porch of his house after opening the front door, according to a report from 6ABC, and added that the man will likely be paralyzed if he survives, according to NBC10.\n\nAnother man was reported in critical condition Wednesday morning at Einstein after he was shot twice on Woodlawn Street, near McMahon Street and Chelten Avenue in East Germantown.\n\nA new study from the University of Pennsylvania finds that severely injured gunshot victims in Philadelphia have been more likely to survive when rushed to hospitals by police rather than medics, noting that police may have shorter response times by virtue of how they patrol.\n\nAccording to the report, patients transported police were still more likely to die \u2014 29.8 percent versus 26.5 percent \u2014 but this may be explained by the more severely injured victims that police typically transport, rather than the mode of transport itself.\n\nThe study also notes that the Philadelphia Police Department has recently issued tourniquets to every police officer in the city. According to a Philadelphia Daily News report, police say that practice has already saved the life of one shooting victim as well as a man who was injured in an accident.\n\nIf you want to get involved in gun violence reduction in Philadelphia, please consider volunteering your time or making a donation to one of the organizations listed under our Network tab at the top of this site.
