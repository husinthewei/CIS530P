[{"text": "HAYWARD \u2014 A 62-year-old woman fatally shot by police Tuesday night at an apartment complex was reportedly upset about a previous contact with police and had threatened officers with a handgun, police said Wednesday.\n\nHayward police were called to the Summerwood Apartment Homes at 21701 Foothill Blvd. around 7:15 p.m. after Pleasanton police requested a welfare check on a woman living there, Hayward police Sgt. Eric Melendez said.\n\nThe woman had made several 911 calls to the Pleasanton police dispatch center, prompting the request, Melendez said.\n\nTwo officers made contact with the woman Tuesday night and were talking to her when police say she displayed a handgun in a threatening manner. Police then retreated to the parking lot of the complex while giving commands for the woman to drop the gun, Melendez said.\n\nWhen the woman refused to drop the weapon, one officer fired four to five shots, Melendez said. That prompted the woman to stagger, fall and roll down the stairs from her second-story apartment. The officer who fired was not identified but is a young officer who has been on the force for one year, police said.\n\nOfficials did not say how many shots hit the woman or where she was struck.\n\nEmergency personnel were called, and the woman was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where she died from her injuries. Both police officers have been put on administrative leave.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time police had come to the apartment.\n\nOn Jan. 24, undercover officers from the Pleasanton Police Department served a search warrant at the Hayward apartment and found guns, drugs and other contraband, said Pleasanton police Sgt. Ted Young. The woman was cited but later released, although her son was arrested and remains in custody. He has been charged with dealing heroin and possession of automatic weapons.\n\nMelendez said Wednesday that the woman had previously called Pleasanton police, saying she was upset about how she had been treated in a recent contact. Asked to elaborate, Sgt. Melendez said he couldn\u2019t do so.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms Explosives Control has taken over that case.\n\nThe woman\u2019s name has not been released pending notification of next of kin. Hayward police are investigating the shooting along with the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nLast August, a Hayward police officer shot and killed 37-year-old Danny Gene Simmons Jr. after his daughter called the police during a domestic disturbance. A tape of the 911 call leading up to the shooting showed Simmons\u2019 daughter told police her father had a long kitchen knife and was threatening her mother with it, although the family has maintained that he never lunged at officers with the weapon.\n\nContact Rick Hurd at 925-945-4789 and follow him at Twitter.com/3rdERH.

When he entered the kitchen, Bishop was struck on the head with a blunt object.\n\nHe was ordered to open his gun safe and the robbers removed three long guns and a pistol. As this was occurring, Bishop\u2019s wife fled to a neighbor\u2019s house.\n\nThe two robbers then left with the guns, police said.\n\nBishop, unsure where his wife was, went to another room in the house and retrieved a pistol. Police said he was outside looking for his wife when he again, encountered the robbers.\n\nDuring the ensuing altercation, Bishop fired on them, fatally wounding Adams. The second robber dropped the long guns and the pistol that had been taken from the safe and ran away. He remained at large late Thursday morning.\n\nAlso Thursday, Bishop remained hospitalized with a skull fracture.\n\nPolice say the victims' home was burglarized on Feb. 6 and a flat screen television was taken. Adams is a suspect in that case, according to police.\n\nAdams has multiple convictions in Cheatham County for the crimes of auto burglary, felony theft and aggravated assault. He was convicted in Nashville of attempted burglary.\n\nAdams was arrested in Nashville on July 28, 2017, on charges of felony meth possession for resale and unlawful gun possession by a convicted felon. He pleaded guilty last November to two misdemeanors in General Sessions Court and was placed on probation.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Daily Briefing newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Start your day with the morning's top news Please try again soon, or contact Customer Service at 1-800-342-8237.

Police have not released the suspect's name.\n\nThe shooting took place around 12:30 p.m. Saturday in an industrial area near the intersection of South Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Victor Avenue.\n\nRelated incidents at two other locations preceded the shooting, Yankowski said.\n\nThe first incident was a shots-fired call at 10:10 a.m. at an apartment complex near the intersection of MLK and Mary Avenue, Yankowski said. In that incident, police believe the suspect fired into an apartment. Nobody was injured.\n\nAround 11 a.m., a female uniformed officer driving a patrol car nearly a mile north of the first incident spotted the suspect on foot near the intersection of MLK and Dunlap Street, the chief said.\n\n\u201cWhen she tried to verbally confront him he produced a firearm and started shooting at her,\" Yankowski said. The officer returned fire, but it's unclear if she struck the suspect. The officer was not injured, he said.\n\nThe suspect then ran north toward an industrial area just south of the train tracks that cross MLK near Victor Avenue, Yankowski said.\n\nBuy Photo Lansing police vehicles outside an apartment in the 1200 block of Mary Avenue, where a suspect later shot by police reportedly shot at a residence on Saturday, March 31, 2018.

Hope Avenue and Holmes Road.\n\nAt 12:20 p.m. troopers in a Michigan State Police helicopter spotted the suspect hiding between a concrete barrier and building at an abandoned lumberyard, Yankowski said.\n\nWhen the department's tactical team approached the man, he fired at its vehicle, Yankowski said. Officers returned fire moments later and hit the man \"multiple times,\" he said.\n\nOfficers then rendered first aid on the suspect, and applied several tourniquets, before the man was taken to a local hospital, Yankowski said. The man was in critical but stable condition early Saturday afternoon, he said.\n\n\u201cThis was a very violent encounter,\" Yankowski said. The suspect \"potentially discharged his firearm at at least one other innocent civilian today.\n\n\u201cOur police officers acted... with extreme bravery,\" he continued. \"As soon as the suspect stopped shooting at the police officers they immediately tried to save his life, and did so.\u201d\n\nThe suspect's condition remained unchanged early Saturday evening, Lansing Police Public Information Director Robert Merritt said.\n\nAt least one of the suspect's bullets damaged the tactical vehicle, Yankowski said. The man's weapon was some sort of handgun, but Yankowski did not immediately have further details.\n\nThree officers \u2014 the patrol officer and two members of the tactical team \u2014 are believed to have fired at the suspect, Yankowski said. All three have been placed on administrative leave per department policy, where they will remain until the investigation into the incidents is complete.\n\nBecause Lansing police were involved, Michigan State Police will lead the overall investigation. A department spokesman did not immediately respond Saturday to a message left seeking comment.\n\nAfter the MSP investigation, Lansing Police will conduct an internal review \"to make sure that our officers followed policy and procedure,\" Yankowski said.\n\nBuy Photo A police officer walks in the tall grass near Hazen Lumber Company on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Saturday, March 31, 2018 looking for an armed suspect.

He was not sure whether the officers on the tactical team were wearing similar cameras, but vowed to release any relevant footage sometime in the future.\n\n\"As soon as we can get that out to the public we will,\" he said.\n\nA two-car crash that took place on MLK around the same time as the first exchange of gunfire was apparently not related to that incident, Yankowski said.\n\nPolice believe the suspect may have also fired his weapon at a \"friend or relative\" in another incident sometime in the preceding day or two, but investigators are still investigating the possible fourth incident, Yankowski said.\n\nThe department's last shooting took place in 2015, when police shot and killed Terrozza Griffin during a standoff in which Griffin set fire to a home and twice fired a weapon at police. The shooting was later ruled justified, and all three officers involved in the shooting were cleared of wrongdoing.\n\nCLOSE At least a dozen police cars visible on MLK, Saturday, March 31, 2018.

The warden checked on the complaint and found ammunition.\n\nHood and Merrifield interviewed the man and he admitted he had a gun and said he had bought it from Vandine, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe gun had been stolen from a home in Newcastle on Oct. 25, 2016.\n\nPolice began checking on Vandine and checking the vehicles he owned to see if they matched surveillance photographs from several break-ins at storage units.\n\nIn one break-in at a Woolwich storage unit, about $100,000 in antiques had been stolen, according to the affidavit. A surveillance photograph showed a vehicle similar to what Vandine owned at the time. A surveillance tape from a nearby convenience store also showed the vehicle and a man going into the store who resembled Vandine\u2019s photo on his Facebook page, according to the police report.\n\nPolice looked into other break-ins, including a May 29, 2017 burglary at a coin shop on West Street in Rockport.\n\nFive days earlier a man fitting Vandine\u2019s description had been in the coin shop and afterward, about $1,000 in coins disappeared, according to the affidavit.\n\nPolice found that Vandine had given some rare coins the previous summer to the man he had sold the stolen gun to, according to the affidavit.\n\nTroopers seized enough items from Vandine\u2019s home on Main Street in Thomaston, vehicle and his own storage locker to load two U-Haul trucks. The items include chainsaws, tools, hunting and fishing equipment, coins, antiques, toys and clothing, according to Maine Department of Public Safety.\n\nOwners who have not checked their own storage units in months could be victims, police said. One tactic used by the burglars was cutting off locks and replacing them with other locks. Storage unit owners and renters who have discovered they are victims should call State Police in Augusta at 624-7076.\n\nVandine is being held in lieu of $10,000 cash bail.

The 13th Circuit Solicitor's Office cleared the deputies of any criminal wrongdoing in that case.\n\nAuthorities said deputies used less-than-lethal tactics to subdue McCarty first before McCarty brandished a pistol and the deputies fired shots.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, 32-year-old Michael Chappell was killed during what was described by authorities as a hostage situation in Simpsonville. Greenville County deputies fired at Chappell when he came out of a house with a hostage. The hostage was not injured.\n\nIn February 2017, deputies shot and killed Jason Mendez, 37, of Fountain Inn, after demanding that he get out of a vehicle.

Late Tuesday the Alameda County Coroner\u2019s office confirmed that he was 42-year-old Sgt. Tom Smith Jr., a 20-year law enforcement veteran.\n\n\u201cThis is a shocking thing for a BART officer to be killed in the line of duty,\u201d said elected BART Director Gail Murray, of Walnut Creek. \u201cBut like all peace officers, our BART police risk their lives when they go out to work in the stations and cities. We feel very saddened for the family, who would not expect (this to) happen to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nAround 2 p.m. Tuesday, a group of four members of BART\u2019s detective unit and several members of Dublin Police and Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s departments, converged on the Park Sierra Apartments, at 6450 Dougherty Road. Wearing bulletproof vests, the group were there to search of an apartment belonging a suspect in several robberies on BART property, authorities said.\n\nThe suspect, whom officials did not name, was already in custody and was not inside the apartment at the time, according to Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is leading the investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe officers began their search by knocking twice on the door. Each knock went unanswered, but the door was unlocked, so several of them stepped inside, Nelson said.\n\nNot knowing whether anyone was inside the apartment, the officers followed protocol and entered with their guns drawn, Nelson said.\n\nThe details of what happened next have not been released, but Nelson said that once inside the apartment, one of the officers fired a single shot from his weapon, wounding Smith, who later died at Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley.\n\nThe name of the BART officer who fired the shot was not released. Nelson said that officer had been in law enforcement for more than 10 years.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I have to announce the tragic loss of the first BART officer killed in the line of duty,\u201d BART police Chief Kenton Rainey said Tuesday evening at the hospital. \u201cWe ask everyone to give us a chance to catch our breath.\u201d\n\nAt the hospital, Rainey and BART General Manager Grace Crunican met with Smith\u2019s family. BART officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies saluted as a gurney was rolled out of the hospital with an American flag draping the body, before it was put into a coroner\u2019s van and taken away, flanked by about 10 law enforcement officers on motorcycles.\n\nThe shooting rattled residents of the sprawling apartment complex in the East Bay suburb. Rosalia Vazquez, who lives several doors down from where the shooting occurred inside the Park Sierra Apartments, said she wasn\u2019t home at the time. But she knew when she arrived home that something had happened because the apartment door was barricaded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet usually. It\u2019s the reason I moved here,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cI\u2019m just in shock. I can\u2019t imagine this happening.\u201d\n\nThe death marked the 36th on-duty officer killed by accidental gunfire in California since 1895. The last time a police officer in Alameda County was killed by another officer was in January 2001, when two Oakland police officers shot and killed an undercover detective.\n\nOfficer William Wilkins was pursing an auto thief near 89th Avenue when Officers Andrew Koponen and Timothy Scarrott arrived as Wilkins drew his weapon on the suspect. Both officers fired several times, killing Wilkins, after they said he ignored orders to drop the weapon.\n\nThe shooting was the latest challenge for the BART system and its police force. Jan. 1 marked five years since BART police officer Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, who was being detained on a platform at the Fruitvale station.\n\nMore recently, the system was shut down by failed contract negotiations that led to strikes that stranded hundreds of thousands of Bay Area commuters in July and October.

With concurrent and consecutive sentences, Calles is facing 26 years in prison.\n\n\u201cAnd no parole,\u201d said Trevor Lynch, the assistant district attorney and lead prosecutor in the case.\n\nThe crime took place in February 2014 at the Smith\u2019s La Vergne home. Isolated on its two acres, their home was a showplace with professional landscaper Sara Smith\u2019s constant work.\n\nAccording to testimony at the sentencing hearing, they answered the door to a young woman, asking questions. About a half an hour later, Rick Smith answered the door again, only to find himself pulled out of the house and beaten and kicked by two assailants. Around the corner of the house was German Calles.\n\nSara Smith came out to defend her husband, and Calles struck her in the head with a \u201cheavy metal object,\u201d believed to be a gun, Lynch said. He told the court that when Rick Smith refused to let them into the house, he was shot in the back by one of the men.\n\nAt that time, Calles fled the scene, but he would later stop at a restaurant.\n\nPublic defender Russell Perkins stated that Calles had been coerced into the crime by men he didn\u2019t even know and was not a willing participant, and that he went on to cooperate with law enforcement later.\n\nLynch said when Calles got to the restaurant, he did not ask to call the police or mention that he\u2019d been kidnapped.\n\nInstead, Lynch said, he asked for a menu, Lynch said. Calles not only ate a meal there, he went home and for six days went to work and then home again, until police caught up with him.\n\nThe woman and the other men involved have never been caught.\n\nCalles\u2019 actions, or lack thereof, after the attack were factors in Bragg\u2019s sentencing decision.\n\n\u201cThe callousness of these individuals, including the defendant in this case, made an impression on this court,\u201d Bragg said in his ruling.\n\nAbout Calles assertion that he was coerced into the crime, Bragg said: \u201cThe court does not find those statements to be credible. Neither did the jury.\u201d\n\nRick and Sara Smith testified at the beginning of the sentencing hearing, and both spoke of their losses.\n\nBesides the medial bills incurred by their injuries \u2014 Rick Smith still carries the bullet in his body and told the court he probably will for the rest of his life, the couple also lost their home \u2014 where he had lived for 28 years and she had joined him for the last 16 \u2014 when they found themselves unable to live there anymore, surrounded by fear and memories.\n\nThey have had to seek counseling and find a new home, but the hardest part, both said, was losing trust in other people.\n\n\u201cI always trusted people,\u201d said Rick Smith. \u201cUntil they shows us differently.\u201d\n\nSara Smith told the court how they used to live with open doors and drapes.\n\n\u201cIt changed our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, our doors were always open; drapes were never closed.

Now, even our children know to call before they come over.\n\n\u201cRick wouldn\u2019t even let me out in the front yard to do yard work in the daytime.\u201d\n\nThe couple has since moved to a different city and have closer neighbors.\n\nThey have had to live through the trauma over and over as the judicial wheels moved forward, they said, knowing the other attackers are still out there.\n\nBut knowing Calles has been convicted and will be in prison for a long time has helped.\n\n\u201cIt was fair,\u201d said Rick Smith as he addressed the court after the sentencing. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Mr. Calles is off the street.\u201d\n\nYou can reach mar at 615-278-5109.

Cheatham Rd. The caller told authorities a male named \u201cMax\u201d threatened her with a gun before walking away.\n\nWhen Deputy Spencer arrived in the area, he observed a vehicle leave the address as he awaited backup Deputies to arrive. Believing the vehicle was probably involved, he conducted a traffic stop in the 4500 block of Cheatham.\n\nHe also observed two males, one of which was carrying a gas can who was later identified as Allen, walking on the side of the road toward the traffic stop.\n\nThe two males inside the vehicle followed commands and placed their hands outside the vehicle and kept them in view of Deputy Spencer. Allen and the second male also followed commands to stand in the front of the vehicle occupied by the two males.\n\nWhen asked, all four males denied being \u201cMax\u201d.\n\n\n\nWhen Deputy Lorenz Mina arrived to assist, Allen who matched the description provided by the victim was identified as having the nickname of Max.\n\nAs Deputy Spencer took control of Allen\u2019s hands to begin a frisk for weapons, Allen dropped multiple items on the ground. Allen was placed in handcuffs and a loaded 9mm FMK handgun was removed from Allen\u2019s right hip. As the weapon was removed, a laser aiming devise fell to the ground and was subsequently recovered.\n\nChecking Allen\u2019s name with dispatch, Deputy Spencer learned Allen was a convicted felon (Residential Burglary-Assault 3rd Degree) which precluded Allen from legally possessing a firearm and he had an extensive history of local law enforcement contacts.\n\nThe items Allen dropped on the ground were found to be his wallet and a clear plastic bag containing a white crystalline substance believed to be Methamphetamine and a brown substance believed to be Heroin.\n\nField tests showed presumptive positive results for those substances.\n\nThe reporting victim stated Allen, who she knew as \u201cMax\u201d, arrived in a black Cadillac and told her, he ran out of gas. When the victim told Allen to leave the property, she observed a handgun in Allen\u2019s waistband and asked him why he had it. Allen said it was for protection and became increasingly agitated after he was told to leave.\n\nAllen pulled the weapon from his waistband and she observed a red laser attached to the weapon turn on. When this happened, she hid behind a vehicle parked on the property.\n\nDeputy Spencer located the vehicle Allen was reportedly driving, parked on Cheatham. As he looked through the windows, Deputy Spencer observed what appeared to be a black semi-automatic rifle, multiple rounds of .223 ammunition on the floor, and a black tactical body armor vest, inside. The vehicle was impounded pending a search warrant.\n\nA second victim was contacted later and he confirmed the version of events provided by the initial victim. He identified Allen as the suspect he\u2019s known as \u201cMax\u201d. He stated Allen pointed the handgun at him. He also observed Allen point the handgun at the female victim and activate a red laser.\n\nAfter being advised of his rights, Allen denied any knowledge of the Cadillac, the drugs recovered and denied any keys were removed from his pocket. However, he did admit he had the pistol on his hip for protection, and that he liked guns.\n\n\n\nAllen was transported and booked into the Spokane County Jail for Assault 2nd Degree, Unlawful Possession of a Firearm 1st Degree, Possession of a Controlled Substance-Methamphetamine, Possession of a Controlled Substance-Heroin and Carrying a Concealed Pistol w/o a License.\n\nA search warrant was later obtained for the Cadillac. A key located on Allen unlocked the doors and truck of the vehicle. A black DPMS semi-automatic rifle and multiple magazines were seized along with, several rounds of ammunition (.223/9mm/.40cal), a black body armor carrier without ballistic panels, digital scales and a bag containing a white crystalline substance. A birth certificate and voter registration card belonging to Allen were also found inside. A field test showed a presumptive positive result for Methamphetamine.\n\nWith the additional evidence, Deputy Spencer completed a charging request where he recommended the addition of a new charge of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm 1st Degree, and the charges of Possession of a Controlled Substance be amended to Possession of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Deliver.", "publish_date": "2018-03-27"}, {"text": "orleans avenue shooting map.jpg\n\nA man was wounded early Friday morning on Orleans Avenue in the Treme district when he struggled with a gunman who approached him.

How could this happen to him? Why him?\" said Craig Pletenik, a Phoenix Union High School District spokesman who related the questions that the counselors received. \"He was at home. Are any of us safe? If you are not safe in your home, where are you safe?\"\n\n\u201cHe always was just such a troubled individual. You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' \u201d Janet Guzzo, Michael Guzzo's ex-wife\n\nPolice said many of the answers to the questions Shannon's classmates were grappling with probably died with Guzzo on Saturday.\n\nGuzzo used a pump-action shotgun to murder Bruce and Shannon Moore, along with Shannon's parents, Michael and Renee, and two of the family's five dogs, in a townhome the family had owned for decades, according to police. Neighbors said Guzzo often argued with pet owners about barking dogs in the development, and police said Guzzo shot at another dog-owning neighbor on Saturday before returning to his own unit and killing himself.\n\nJanet Guzzo, who was married to Guzzo for more than a decade before they divorced in 1999, said the barking dogs and the presence of a weapon, coupled with Guzzo's extreme depression and increasing isolation, could have all contributed to Saturday's murders.\n\n\"He always was just such a troubled individual,\" said Janet, a psychiatric nurse. \"You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' \"\n\nThere were few new details Monday about the family Guzzo murdered, aside from school officials' comments and information available through court records.\n\nA relative of the Moores' declined to comment Monday when reached at her home.\n\nA neighbor who has lived in the complex for more than 40 years said Bruce Moore moved to the unit to care for a relative and that his daughter and her family had joined him within the last few years.\n\nShannon was a student at Phoenix's Central High School before he transferred to Desiderata in April, Pletenik said. Word about Shannon's death had spread quickly through the tiny school Monday, Pletenik said, where about 40 students had met with counselors.\n\n\"Something like this impacts them a lot because of the size of the school,\" Pletenik said.\n\nMichael worked at a pharmacy during the early 2000s when he also was attending college and pursuing a degree in criminal justice, according to court records.\n\nRenee and Michael were married in March 1996, divorced in 2004 and were re-married in January 2006, according to court documents.\n\nCourt filings list Michael's employer as the U.S. Army, but government officials were unable to confirm any details related to his service.\n\nNeighbors said that Renee and Michael had recently returned from China and that Renee was excited to get her five dogs out of quarantine.

He was later transported to the hospital with a leg injury.\n\nAs the suspect fled the scene, he may have accidentally shot himself in the leg as well, Simpson said.\n\n\"The suspect's wound is consistent with somebody putting a gun in his pants,\" Simpson said.\n\nJosh Howell, a 42-year-old resident of the same building, told a reporter at the scene that he heard two loud noises but wasn't sure what they were. He left the building to investigate, and said the suspect walked past him and told Howell to call an ambulance because he had been shot.\n\nThe suspect then went inside the apartment building, Howell said.\n\nHowell said he saw another man getting up off the ground in a nearby parking lot. That man staggered off with a woman toward Safeway, said Howell, who then ran inside.\n\nPolice with shields and assault rifles descended upon the apartment building and began canvassing the area. Police later found the wounded suspect on Southwest Sixth Avenue and Mill Street. Simpson said the suspect may have slipped out the window of his apartment.\n\nThe suspect was also transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nNo arrests have been made at this time.\n\n-- Shane Dixon Kavanaugh", "publish_date": "2014-01-29"}, {"text": "Crime scene tape surrounds the victim\u2019s car after a 60-year-old man was critically wounded during a robbery and shooting Tuesday night in the Oxford Circle section of Philadelphia.

Image\n\nCHAMPAIGN \u2014 When it comes to property crimes, there are certain stolen items that can make even the toughest police officer cringe.\n\nLike 24 brand-new handguns taken all at once.\n\nThat's how many guns thieves made off with in a smash-and-grab break-in last summer at the Rural King Supply store, 913 W. Marketview Drive, C. A week earlier, a thief made off with a single rifle from the same store.\n\n\"We hate it when one gets stolen,\" said Urbana police Sgt. Dan Morgan. \"When there's a large number in a single incident, it's a concern because of the flooding of better quality guns in the area.\"\n\nChampaign police Sgt. Dave Griffet has been keeping a running tally of the Rural King guns that have resurfaced following Aug. 25 and Sept. 3 break-ins at the store. So far, seven of the handguns have been recovered: four in Urbana and three in Champaign on five different occasions. And of that number, at least two were in the hands of men with gang affiliations.\n\nIn none of the incidents involving recovered guns was anyone shot, but two men were beaten and robbed in Urbana.\n\nThe latest recovery came Tuesday afternoon when Gabriel Chaney, 20, of Champaign, was arrested for allegedly threatening a teen with a Ruger .357 inside the Popeye's Chicken at 910 Bloomington Road, C. He was charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and aggravated assault.\n\nGriffet said police have been investigating the Rural King burglaries since they happened but have yet to learn who was responsible, even after recovering the stolen handguns. The people from whom they were recovered shed no light on the underlying burglary, he said.\n\n\"There were various makes, models and calibers,\" he said. \"They were all taken in the one event after the rifle.\"\n\nIn both break-ins, the store was apparently entered in the early morning hours through an overhead service door in what used to be the automotive department when the store was a Walmart, Griffet said.\n\n\"They broke out the glass in the doors and climbed in and entered the business to go in to steal. With the rifle, the person who came in did so in a similar fashion, ran behind the counter, grabbed the rifle and ran out,\" he said. That burglary happened at 3:45 a.m.\n\nTwo men with their faces disguised were responsible for the theft of the handguns in the Sept. 3 burglary. It happened about 2:15 a.m.\n\n\"They came in in the old automotive area, went to hardware, grabbed a sledge hammer and used it to break into the gun cases. There were alarms that did go off. However, the time delay is what allowed them to escape,\" Griffet said.\n\nPolice obtained surveillance video of both crimes, he said.\n\nHere are a few known details surrounding the recovery of the other six guns:\n\n\u2014 Sept. 19: Champaign police Sgt. Dennis Baltzell developed information that Vincent Mosley, 27, had one of the stolen guns at his home in the 1200 block of North Walnut Street in Champaign and was also selling drugs. In a court-authorized search, Baltzell found a .40-caliber semi-automatic and about 3 grams of crack cocaine. Mosley is due back in court March 4 on charges of armed violence, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.\n\n\u2014 Sept. 30, 2:40 a.m.: Urbana police responded to a shots fired call in the 2400 block of Prairie Green. Inside an apartment building hallway, an officer could hear a gun slide being pulled back. The officer made contact but none of the several adults present said they knew anything about a gun. The officer got a search warrant and found three guns, a SIG Sauer, a Walther, and a Ruger in the toilet tank. There were no arrests made and the guns were returned to Champaign police.\n\n\u2014 Jan. 5: Champaign police stopped a car for traffic violations and after smelling burned cannabis, searched it. They found a loaded Glock pistol under the front passenger seat and a backpack in the trunk with .40 caliber ammunition.\n\nArrested were Brandon Ward, 22, and Davion Hedrick, 24, both of Champaign. Ward is due back in court April 8 on a charge of possession of a stolen firearm. Hedrick was charged with possession of a stolen firearm and unlawful use of weapons by a felon. He's due in court Feb. 19.\n\n\u2014 Jan. 12: A Glock stolen from Rural King was recovered from Andrew Bell, 19, of Champaign. He was one of five men charged with armed robbery and aggravated vehicular hijacking for allegedly beating and robbing two men of cash, a cellphone and a pickup truck on Hunter Street about 3 a.m. that day. Urbana police also recovered a second handgun that was not linked to Rural King and a BB gun. Bell is due back in court Tuesday.\n\nGriffet said the retail value of the 24 handguns was put at $11,167. The stolen rifle was valued at $389.\n\n\"Many are being sold for a couple hundred to a few hundred dollars on the street when their true value is anywhere form $350 to $500,\" the officer observed.\n\nGriffet said \u2014 and Scot Kersten, Rural King's vice president of marketing and advertising confirmed \u2014 that the store had taken steps to improve the security of its weapons. Kersten declined to give any details or to say if other Rural King stores in central Illinois have had similar problems.\n\nAnyone with information on any of the stolen weapons is encouraged to call Champaign police at 217-351-4545 or Champaign County Crimestoppers at 217-373-8477.
