He received an additional 93 years suspended upon numerous conditions.\n\nYates also has an additional five years to serve on Nottoway County convictions this year for grand larceny and breaking and entering.\n\nAccording to Commonwealth Attorney Robert Clement, a jury trial was planned for November 4th and 5th, but the defendant expressed a willingness to plead guilty in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence. Clement said that he would have preferred a more significant sentence, but due to a \u201csnitch\u201d mentality among nearly all of the witnesses, he felt more secure with a \u201csure thing\u201d rather than having to count upon reluctant, uncooperative witnesses. \u201cSome refused to talk to law enforcement, and some refused to meet with me,\u201d said Clement. The prosecutor did, however, highly commend one of the victims, Standrekas Woods, for his full cooperation, precise observations, and ability to express his testimony fully and forcefully. Clement added that the victims and law enforcement officers agreed to the disposition.\n\n\u201cIronically, those persons who did not want to \u201csnitch\u201d did not realize that Yates \u201csnitched\u201d on one of his closest friends, Robert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields, the driver of the vehicle. In his interview in Texas where he was found after the shooting, Yates said he had left the party before the shootings, and that Fields had given him the gun to take to Texas later that day. He said Fields admitted to him in a telephone conversation that Fields had shot the men.\n\nFields, on the other hand, would not identify Yates as the shooter in his first four interviews until he was shown the video of Yates in Texas blaming him for the shooting. Fields then went ballistic, calling Yates a liar and saying Yates was the shooter. He then looked right into the camera in the interview room and shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re (deleted) whacked. You are lying. You\u2019re supposed to be my (deleted) brother, man.\u201d He told the investigator to be sure she showed Yates the video of this interview. \u201cDon\u2019t let him miss it.\u201d He then raised his hands up, showing the handcuffs to the camera, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because of you.\u201d\u201d\n\nYates will be under conditions of good behavior for 118 years, supervised probation for five years upon his release, warrant-less searches and seizures, no contact with the victims, restitution for any medical expenses, not knowingly being within 100 feet of any firearms except law enforcement officers and commercial establishments, and staying out of Lunenburg County for ten years upon his release.\n\nAccording to Clement, the charges arose from a shooting at 2073 Pleasant Oak Road, Victoria, Virginia after physical altercations between Lunenburg men and Nottoway men during a birthday party for a Lunenburg female on May 18, 2013.\n\nDetails provided below were taken from a written Stipulation of Evidence signed by the defendant as to what he expected the Commonwealth to prove in court, revealed the following facts:\n\nAll witnesses would have been in agreement that Richsean Hawkes hosted a birthday party cookout for Destiny Brown, a friend. Approximately 25 to 35 individuals eventually showed up.\n\nA number of the witnesses became aware that around 11:30 p.m., Robert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields drove up in his father\u2019s minivan with six friends from Nottoway. (Fields is the father of the baby of Destiny Brown). A number of the witnesses expressed concern that the \u201cNottoway\u201d men had come to the party, because of past tensions with Lunenburg County individuals. They would testify that Brandon Townsend of Lunenburg stood on the front porch at one point and angrily yelled at one of the Nottoway men, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d because of the manner and stance that the Nottoway man posed. Townsend was convinced by some of the women to go back into the house, but came out later and fussed again. One of the Nottoway men yelled something to the effect of not being disrespected in this way. As some of the Lunenburg and Nottoway men became more aggressive, some of the Lunenburg men and women tried to defuse the situation and calm them down. Two of these men who tried to calm things down were the victims, Stan Woods and Dequan Jones. Witnesses would say that Dequan Jones was then jumped and hit from the side, and then fought back. As he was fighting, another Nottoway man tried to get him, but a Lunenburg man pushed him away, and said words to the effect that it would have to be a fair fight, one on one. He pushed the Nottoway man twice to stop him, and they ended up in the road in front of the house. They squared off with each other to fight, and the Lunenburg man hit him in the face with one punch and knocked him out. Stan encouraged Chuckie Fields to get his friend and leave. Chuckie dragged his friend to the minivan, put him inside, and the other Nottoway men got inside also.\n\n(Some of the Nottoway men said the minivan was surrounded and being hit and kicked, but none of the Commonwealth\u2019s Lunenburg witnesses confirmed this.)\n\nAt this point, shots were fired. Five or six witnesses would testify that the shots came from inside the minivan which was parked at the back of the driveway facing the house, with five shots fired through the windshield, and two more shots fired from the side after the van had backed into the road and as it drove away.\n\nThe four victims were hit by the gunfire as described below.\n\nStandrekas \u201cStan\u201d Woods is a 2009 graduate of Central High School, and attended one year at the local community college before becoming a correctional officer for the Virginia Department of Corrections.\n\nStan said that around 11:00 pm or 11:30 p.m., his friend, Richsean Hawkes, called and asked him to come to his house and drive him to town to buy some cigarettes because he had been drinking and did not want to drive. When he came back, he sat on the porch talking to Hawkes and one of the Nottoway men in friendly conversation.\n\nWhen the arguments began, Stan stopped one Lunenburg man from being aggressive toward the Nottoway man who had been on the porch, pointing out that he had not done anything.\n\nStan then went to get his younger brother, Dontaris, in order to leave. He saw the fights described above, and peacefully encouraged the Nottoway men to leave. He and his brother walked to his car in the driveway where it was parked just in front of the minivan. He walked around the front of the car, and Dontaris walked behind the car calling out for a friend who had ridden with him. His car was parked on the road further beyond the driveway.\n\nStan said that as he put the key in lock to the door of his car, he heard two shots, and saw his brother, Dontaris, fall to the ground. He then turned and looked at the minivan, saw two bullet holes in the windshield, and plainly saw the defendant, Codarrell Yates, pointing a handgun toward him from inside the minivan from the back, reaching between the two front seats. The ceiling light was on just above his face, giving Stan a good view of Yates. Stan said Yates yelled, \u201cTHAT\u2019S HOW YA\u2019LL WANT TO PLAY ? AIN\u2019T NO REASON TO RUN NOW.\u201d\n\nStan said he could see Chuckie (Robert Fields) in the driver\u2019s seat, and the light-skinned guy in the passenger seat.\n\nStan said YATES looked at him dead in the face, pointing the gun at him.\n\nSTAN yelled \u201cNO!!!\u201d and saw and heard the shot fired by Yates and felt the bullet hit him in the chest.\n\nSTAN sank down by the car, and played dead. He said he heard two more shots, and then a few seconds later he heard two more shots down the road just as the van accelerated and drove away.\n\nStan looked up and saw they were gone. He said he ran around the car and went up to the sidewalk where he fell.\n\nA friend and other Lunenburg men and women got shirts, towels and sheets and applied pressure to the wounds of the four victims.\n\nStan said he looked up at the moon, which was nearly full, and thought, \u201cThis is the last moon I\u2019m going to see.\u201d\n\nStan was driven to the hospital in South Hill along with Trey Ghee, who had been injured. Dequan Jones and Dontaris Woods were driven to the Victoria Rescue Squad and transported to South Hill. All four men were then transported to MCV Hospital in Richmond.\n\nDequan Jones also attended Central High School. He would testify concerning the fighting described above, and said he then walked over to his car which was parked a little further up the driveway in front of Stan. He would testify that he heard the gunfire and turned to look, but then turned back to the person he had been talking to. He then suddenly felt a burning pain to his right ear. It turned out that a bullet had cut his earlobe and either the same bullet or a second bullet entered the side of his head at the ear while his head was turned sideways. He said he did not see the shooting itself.\n\nDontaris Woods apparently was the first man shot, but said he did not see the shooting itself. He was struck in the face and in his left arm near the wrist.\n\nTreyvious Ghee said he came out of the house and saw the fighting going on. As he and a friend were walking in the yard, he was hit in the side of his head, just above his ear. He fell to the ground unconscious. He also did not see the shooter.\n\nFemale Witness, who will not be identified here at her request, said that she saw a man standing in the minivan \u201cwith hair\u201d (referring, she said, to long braids, like the defendant had) shooting from the side of the minivan as it drove away.\n\nRobert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields was the man who drove the Nottoway men to the party. He is charged as an accomplice (for driving the vehicle as the last shots were fired and getting away from the scene, allowing Yates to flee). He is charged with the same crimes as Yates, except for the possession of a firearm by a felon.\n\nFields was interviewed by law enforcement at least four times, refusing to identify the shooter, at times stating he just heard the shots and ducked down in the driver\u2019s seat, and stating that one of the friends was still unconscious from being knocked out in the fight, and another friend in the front passenger seat fainted when the first shot rang out. He always strongly denied that he had shot the gun. He later said that the police knew who had shot the gun, but he would not say the name.\n\nIn exchange for his agreement to testify against Yates and his agreement to waive the preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth has agreed to allow Fields to plead guilty to one count of malicious wounding as an accomplice and receive one year active sentence.\n\nYates fled to Texas later in the day, driven by a female friend, Deidre Fowlkes. When found by law enforcement officers in Arlington, Texas, Yates ran on foot, and tried to hide in some brush. A tracking dog was used, and he was found lying in some tall grass. At first he would not get up as commanded, but when police threatened to release the dog, he jumped up. He said he had fled to Texas to avoid a sentencing hearing in Nottoway Circuit Court on a conviction of burglary the Monday after the party.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Multiple bullet wounds at SW Houston gas station send man to hospital\n\nA man who was shot multiple times at a southwest Houston gas station Thursday was taken by ambulance to a hospital, police said.\n\nThe shooting happened about 1:30 p.m. Thursday at a Valero station parking lot in the 12300 block of Fondren, Houston Police Department spokeswoman Jodi Silva said.\n\n\"A caller stated to us that there was a male shot in the parking lot,\" she said. \"Multiple shots were fired.\"\n\nSilva said the preliminary information did not include how many shots were fired.\n\nKPRC reports that the man was shot 13 times and is expected to survive.\n\nA male suspect in a yellow shirt left the scene, the caller told police.", "publish_date": "2014-01-09"}, {"text": "Alleged robber fatally shot\n\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 A man police say tried to rob a convenience store Friday night on the Northeast Side died after being shot by the store's clerk.\n\nSan Antonio Police Sgt.

A Multnomah County grand jury Friday found that bouncer Jonathan Baer, 31, acted within state law when he fatally shot a masked gunman in the back after Baer had just seen the gunman shoot his co-worker in the head.\n\n(Thomas Boyd/The Oregonian)\n\nBouncer Jonathan Baer was leaning against a metal railing inside the Mystic Gentlemen's Club, his back to the front doors, when suddenly he heard three gunshots.\n\nHe turned toward the sound and saw a man wearing a clown-type mask, holding a black revolver. Baer saw his co-worker, bouncer Brian T. Rizzo, fall backward onto the floor, bleeding from his face.\n\n\"Is this real? Is it joke, a fake? \" Baer told police he wondered at first.\n\nBaer, 31, followed the masked gunman out of the club's interior doors to the entrance foyer and drew his own Glock .40-caliber pistol from his hip. He looked back one or two times to check on Rizzo, who hadn't gotten up.\n\nWhile using one foot to prop open the club's inner door, Baer said he saw the masked man reach the front door. The man stopped and looked as if he were going to turn around. Baer said he leaned forward and fired two to three rounds.\n\nBaer, who has a concealed handgun license, told investigators he didn't really think, but just \"reacted in trying to stop a murderer'' that Jan. 11 night, according to police investigative reports obtained Friday by The Oregonian in response to a public records request.\n\nBaer later explained to detectives that he had thought about two dancers and two customers who were standing outside the club smoking. He said he didn't want anyone else to get hurt. He first considered tackling the suspect, but realized that would put him in danger. Baer also told police he wears a bulletproof vest to the club when he works there one night a week.\n\nA Multnomah County grand jury Friday found Baer's actions were justified under state law and issued no criminal charges.\n\nPortland police later released about 90 pages of officer reports, which detail witness accounts of the chaotic scene in the darkened Southeast Portland strip club. About 30 people were inside when the bullets flew. Some thought the shots were fireworks. Others thought balloons were popping or a cap gun went off.\n\nOnce they saw Rizzo collapse and a masked man holding a gun, they ran for cover, screaming, \"He's been shot!'' Some ducked into the bathrooms. The chef ran into a large kitchen cooler.\n\nThomas Eliott Hjelmeland, 2013 arrest\n\nThe gunman, later identified as Thomas Elliot Hjelmeland, fell to the ground outside the club's front doors. A customer, Lennie Montgomery, 26, ran out. Baer directed Montgomery to roll the wounded man over and grab his gun, the reports said. He did and handed Hjelmeland's Taurus 6 shot .357-caliber revolver to Baer. Baer emptied the weapon and later handed it, three spent casings and two bullets to the bartender of the adjacent Falco's Pub. Montgomery's sister, Rayna Montgomery, pulled off Hjelmeland's mask, described as white and pink with fake white hair attached.\n\nDavid Welch, another Mystic patron, came to Hjelmeland's aid.

Welch told police Hjelmeland was conscious and kept repeating, \"Where is Superdave?'' -- an apparent reference to the club's general manager, David Dueck, who was called away from a Portland Trail Blazers game to respond to the club shooting. Hjelmeland also uttered, \"I'm gonna die,'' witnesses said.\n\nHjelmeland, 43, arrived at OHSU Hospital with a blood-alcohol content of .20, the police reports indicate. He died days later from a single gunshot wound to the back.\n\nRizzo, 26, shot once above his left eye, was found lying on his back, unconscious, gasping for breath, witnesses told police. He remains in critical condition at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center.\n\n\"It's going to be a slow recovery,'' the club's co-owner, Connie R. Barnes, said Friday.\n\nPortland police learned that Rizzo had turned Hjelmeland away from the club about 30 minutes earlier because he had made racist remarks about other patrons waiting to get in. Hjelmeland, the police reports said, had asked Rizzo that night, \"Why you letting all these illegal Mexican immigrants in ahead of me?''\n\nPolice found Hjelmeland's 2005 Subaru Impreza in the rear parking lot of the nearby 24-Hour Fitness at Mall 205. He had walked back to the club along Southeast Washington Street. He entered at 8:39 p.m., shot Rizzo once in the head and fired two more shots.\n\nWaitress Nichole D. Procter, 27, was giving change to a customer by the video poker machines along the front wall of the club about five feet from Rizzo. She said she heard a loud pop, thought it was a balloon, but after hearing a second one, felt a \"strong burning pain on both of my legs.'' Procter ran to the office in the back of the club. She later received six stitches to the back of her right thigh. Another bullet lodged in the right foot of patron Gonzalo Zamora-Hernandez, 31.\n\nHjelmeland had been living out of his car, his parents told police. Just after the first of the year, he had been denied a job because he had tested positive for marijuana in a drug test. His parents said he was never diagnosed with mental illness, but they suspected he was bipolar because he struggled with significant highs and sudden lows.\n\nPolice discovered plastic baggies in a hidden compartment of his car holding multiple rounds of .38-caliber and .357-caliber ammunition and buckshot rounds. Police also found another Halloween-type mask and 10 31-round Glock pistol magazines, fully loaded.\n\n--Maxine Bernstein", "publish_date": "2014-02-01"}, {"text": "MOUNT OLIVE \u2014 An off-duty federal law enforcement officer accidentally set off a weapon while cleaning it Wednesday afternoon, spurring an investigation from the Morris County Prosecutor's Office and Mount Olive Police Department, according to an announcement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mount Olive Police Cpl.

Police have not received any tips from the community, which they say is highly unusual, especially considering the number of people murdered.\n\nAccording to Chief Bob Hundley Jr. with the Paris Police Department, a female called shortly before 11:30 p.m. to report that someone was bleeding at a home in the 400 block of Northeast Sixth Street. When authorities arrived at the scene, four victims were found dead toward the front of the home, all with gunshot wounds. The female 911 caller had come by the house to visit one of the male victims.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty violent situation. I\u2019ve been a police officer here for 39 years . I can\u2019t recall any multiple homicides that we\u2019ve had,\u201d said Chief Bob Hundley.\n\nThe victims were identified as 18-year-old Romello Dewain Steward of Paris, 21-year-old Devante Larry Adkins of Paris, 24-year-old Brijonne Rashad Woods of Paris and 32-year-old Billy Charles Carey of Garland. Denise Powell, an assistant pastor at Mt. Pisgah Baptist church knew victim Romello Steward as a child.\n\n\u201cAt vacation bible school they were just normal kids, ready to learn probably a lot more than they were learning but they never gave us any problems,\u201d she said.\n\nThe potential for this being a murder-suicide case has been ruled out by crime scene detectives. Police are treating the case as a homicide, but have not given any information about possible suspects or witnesses at this point.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I could say to ease the concern of the community is that it doesn\u2019t appear to be a random act of violence that you would think the community would be concerned about,\u201d Cpt. Danny Huff, an investigator with the Paris Police Dept.\n\nThe investigation found that two other men were at the home at some point on Wednesday night. One of those men has been arrested on an unrelated charge. The other man has been interviewed by authorities.\n\nParis is located about 100 miles northeast of Dallas. The city is home to around 25,000 people. Pastor JWT Spies said he\u2019s been in touch with the victims families.\n\n\u201cThey are devastated. They are hurt. They are baffled by what has taken place,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me this is unheard in a small town like this.\u201d\n\nOfficer Joe Harn with the Garland Police Department confirmed that Carey had a criminal history dating back to 1995, with arrests for theft, assault, burglary and marijuana possession.

But hours after the rampage began, it was still unclear whether the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, or if other shooters were involved.\n\nThirteen people are dead and at least eight others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, officials said, spreading fear and chaos across the region as authorities sought to contain the panic.\n\nThe incident, in which the death toll rose almost hourly, represents the single worst loss of life in the District since an airliner plunged into the Potomac River in 1982, killing 78.\n\nD.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and Mayor Vincent C. Gray announced the mounting number of casualties in a series of news conferences. The suspected shooter, identified by the FBI as Aaron Alexis, 34, living in Fort Worth, is among the dead. Alexis was a military contractor, one official said.\n\nHours after the rampage began it remained unclear whether the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, or if other shooters were involved. Lanier initially said authorities were looking for two more potential shooters dressed in military style clothing. Shortly after she announced a detailed description of two suspects, city officials said one had been located and cleared. And at a 10 p.m. news conference she said police were comfortable the shooting had been committed by one person.\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information on the suspect to call 202-727-9099.\n\nLanier lifted the shelter in place order for the neighborhood around the Navy Yard that had been in place for much of the day.\n\nGray said those killed by the shooter ranged in age from 46-73 years old. He said the families of seven of the victims had been notified. Those victims were identified as: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.\n\nThe families of the six other victims were in the process of being notified.\n\nLanier said one of those killed was a District resident, but she did not identify the person.\n\nGray said another eight people were injured in the attack. He said three people were shot, including Metropolitan Police Officer Scott Williams. Gray said the officer was doing well.\n\nThe other five had either stress related injuries, and at least one was someone who fell.\n\nVice Adm. Bill French earlier had said that the number of injured was 14.\n\n[For up to the minute information about the shooting, check The Post\u2019s live blog .]\n\nGray said no motive is known yet. He said there is no reason to believe it was an act of terrorism, though he added that he could not rule it out.\n\nAs of 8:30 p.m. Monday, Navy officials said about 2,000 people remained on base, and that it could take another 3-4 hours before everyone was cleared to leave.\n\nThe FBI was still interviewing every person leaving the base out of concern that a second suspect may still be at large, French said. And SWAT teams are still finding people hiding in places on the base, where some had remained hunkered down since the initial attack early Monday morning. One city officials said that shortly before 7 p.m., officers found an employee hiding in a locker, where the employee had been for nearly 11 hours.\n\nThroughout the day, people had been warned to stay in their homes and offices on the Naval Base as the incident unfolded.\n\nAlexis was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, two law enforcement officials said. One said he also had a shotgun. One official said all the weapons have not been accounted for.\n\nThe first, sketchy details about the suspect offered few hints about what may have gone wrong.\n\n[Read our full story about Aaron Alexis.]\n\nAlexis grew up in Brooklyn with his mother, Cathleen, and father, Anthony Alexis, according to his aunt Helen Weeks.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen him for years,\u201d Weeks said of her nephew in a telephone interview. \u201cI know he was in the military. He served abroad. I think he was doing some kind of computer work.\u201d\n\nAlexis spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist from May 2007 until he was discharged in January 2011, according to a summary of his personnel records released by Navy officials at the Pentagon.\n\nThe officials said they were still researching whether Alexis had been employed as a defense contractor or a civilian employee of the Navy, and were uncertain if he was assigned to work at the Navy Yard.\n\nHe achieved his final rank of Aviation Electrician\u2019s Mate 3rd Class in December 2009. Officials said they did not immediately know the reasons for his discharge.\n\nThe carnage began around 8 a.m. when the U.S. Navy said that three shots were fired at Building 197, headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command. About 3,000 people work in the building. As the noise that some thought sounded like construction work continued, the realization set in that a gunman was firing on them.\n\nRick Mason, a program management analyst who is a civilian with the U.S. Navy, told the Associated Press that a gunman was shooting from a fourth floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the gunman was aiming at people in the building\u2019s first floor cafeteria.\n\nTerry Durham said that as she and co-workers were evacuating, she saw a man down the hall raise a rifle and fire toward them, hitting a wall.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word,\u201d said her co-worker, Todd Brundage.\n\nOne man who said he was at his desk on the second floor when the shooting began recalled hearing a loud noise \u201clike someone dropping an old metal desk.\u201d The man, who declined to give his name, said there was a pause, then several noises close together and he realized the danger: \u201cThere\u2019s a shooter in the building. I started walking toward the door and I heard people running down the hall.\u201d\n\nEmployees described the chaos, as a fire alarm sounded and people shouted, \u201cWhere is he? Where is he?\u201d\n\nGregory Dade, a Navy contractor, said he and a co-worker locked themselves in a second floor office of Building 197 as soon as the shooting went on, in fits and stops. Dade, called it \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\nHe heard a woman scream, glass crashing and a series of gun shots. Then he heard shouting: \u201cGet down! Get down! This is the police.\u201d\n\nFinally, about 11 a.m., he and a co-worker made a break for it.\n\nAt an exit, they noticed a trail of blood running to the next building.\n\nTim Jirus, a Navy commander who works in Building 197, said that as he was evacuating the building he saw a co-worker who had been shot getting into a police car, and heard more shots fired from inside his workplace.\n\nA far worse sight lay just ahead. Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe, and talked briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. It caused him to spin around to look for the source of the noise. But when he turned back, he looked down and saw the man he had been conversing with lying on the ground, shot in the head.\n\nUncertain where the shooter was, he ran.\n\n\u201cI was just lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other person was shorter than me. There were two shots, he got that guy, he didn\u2019t get me. . . . The randomness of it \u2014 standing right next to me, one person gets shot.\u201d\n\nAt least two police officers were among those shot. Lanier said the D.C. officer worked in the K-9 unit and has been on the force 23 years. She said she has known and worked closely with him for \"many, many years.\"\n\n\"He's got a stellar record,\" she said.\n\n\"He's got a pretty serious injury, but right now his family is here with him and he's in good spirits,\" Lanier added. \"He's just very grateful for all the other responders who helped get him out of that building and get the medical attention he needed.\"\n\nThe other was said to be a base officer. Earlier in the say officials at MedStar Washington Hospital Center said his chances for survival were good.\n\nJanis Orlowski, the chief medical officer at Washington Hospital Center, said three victims in all were brought to the center, all in critical condition but alert, responsive and able to talk with doctors. The victims were also able to speak briefly to law enforcement officers before undergoing surgery or treatment, she said.\n\nThe other two victims at the hospital were female civilians, Orlowski said at a news conference. All are likely to survive.\n\nThe impact of the incident rippled across town, forces schools, offices and homes into an enforced lockdown.\n\nSenate buildings on Capitol Hill went on lockdown at about 3 p.m., with no one allowed to enter or leave the building, though it was partially lifted toward the end of the day to allow staffers to go home.\n\nThe Nationals, whose ballpark is near the Navy Yard, postponed a Monday night game. Instead, they will play a double header Tuesday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nTen public and charter schools and a public school administration building in the District went on lockdown, and flights out of Reagan National Airport were briefly halted, causing delays even after they began departing again.\n\nAdm. Jonathan W.

Johnson wielded what appeared to be a real gun; it was later identified as a replica BB gun.\n\nSpokane County Prosecutor Larry Haskell ruled the shooting justified in July. Johnson\u2019s mother, Sharon Johnson, has reviewed motel surveillance footage and said it appeared her son \u2013 who has severe schizophrenia \u2013 instigated the shooting.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty clear from the evidence and videotape that it was an attempt by Aaron to commit suicide by cop,\u201d his aunt, Judy Noritake, said Wednesday.\n\nThe Spokesman-Review\n\nThe officer, identified Wednesday as Shane Phillips, fired nine times from behind a waist-high wall, where he took cover after Johnson chased him down the long balcony.\n\nPhillips\u2019 body camera was not activated at the time of the shooting, but his voice can be heard on another officer\u2019s footage, repeatedly shouting \u201cGet down!\u201d before shots ring out.\n\nOfficer Teresa Fuller, a police spokeswoman, said Phillips didn\u2019t record the incident because he had turned his camera completely off to save battery power after responding to a previous incident. The cameras can be left on while not recording, but still draining the battery, so officers often turn them completely off, Fuller said.\n\nThe Spokane Police Department has yet to finalize policies that dictate when officers must activate their body cameras.\n\nSince the shooting, every officer in the department has been outfitted with a newer camera model from manufacturer Taser International that features a longer battery life, Lt. Steve Wohl said.\n\nThe Spokesman-Review\n\nWohl also said the number of shots was justifiable because Phillips fired in rapid succession and needed to be sure he had neutralized the apparent threat.\n\nAn officer handcuffed Johnson about three minutes after the shooting, as he lay face-down on the balcony. Paramedics arrived, and the ambulance left the parking lot about five minutes later.\n\nIt was the third time a Spokane police officer shot a man during a five-day period, prompting calls for mental health care reform by local leaders.\n\nOn April 29, two officers shot and killed Mike Kurtz, a homeless man who was threatening them with a knife outside the House of Charity. And on May 1, officers shot and injured 34-year-old Charleston D.
