[{"text": "Authorities in Ocean County announced Friday they dismantled a \"sophisticated\" drug ring that had tentacles in seven different New Jersey counties and New York and led to 28 arrests, the seizure of more than 90,000 doses of heroin and 191 pounds of cocaine, and $850,000 in cash. The widespread operation, dubbed \"Operation Heading Back,\" began in April and involved 30 state, county and local law enforcement agencies. It was announced at a press conference at the Ocean County administration building in Toms River. Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato, who called this the biggest drug bust in the county in 30 years, said the investigation spawned from a drug transaction in Lakewood and continued to move north. One of the busts, he said, led to the seizure of 8 kilos of cocaine and a loaded AK-47. Prosecutors have been working feverishly to keep the suspect arrested in that raid, Rasheed Sanders of East Orange, behind bars after a judge initially ruled at his pre-trial detention hearing that he could be released with high-level monitoring. A new detention hearing for Sanders is scheduled for Monday at 9 a.m. after prosecutors filed additional charges against him. The bust also led to the seizure of 20 firearms, including 18 handguns, and the dismantling of nine drug-producing facilities in Bloomfield, Jackson, Parlin, Paterson, Piscataway (4) and Plainfield. It also included the seizure of 27 vehicles, including a 2014 Jaguar XKR valued at $80,000. Coronato said the ring was a \"sophistic drug network,\" where the dealers were \"true business dealers\" who were able to broker deals to maximize profits. \"They would go in and negotiate with different drug dealers to get the better price and to get the quantity and when they could get the quantity,\" Coronato explained. \"So one time they would go to one drug dealer for their cocaine, if they didn't get a good enough price, they would go to the other drug dealer to get a better price on the cocaine.\" The bust couldn't have happened, Coronato said, without the help of its federal partners through the Drug Enforcement Administration's Ocean/Monmouth High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. First Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Davenport said \"effects like this criminal organization are not just felt in Ocean County\" but \"through the state and beyond.\" \"By partnering together, as you see here today, we can increase our impact and make our streets safer and make our state safer,\" Davenport said. All 1,901 people killed by opioids in N.J. last year, mapped Data obtained by NJ Advance Media shows the death toll from opioids in 2016 exceeds the population of more than 70 N.J. towns. Coronato said \"Ocean County, unfortunately, has been designated as Ground Zero for the opioid epidemic in New Jersey. \"When I first became prosecutor,\" he continued, \"it became really known to me that this is something we need to attack and that we certainly need to address.\" Ocean County, which was one of the first counties in the state to begin equipping its first responders with Narcan as part of a pilot program administered under Gov. Chris Christie, has reduced its drug overdose deaths by 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, Coronato said. When asked why Ocean County is considered \"Ground Zero\" for the opioid epidemic, he said authorities continue to do studies to determine why. \"We're trying to track back why Ocean County is the epicenter,\" he explained. \"It is a bedroom community. With opiates, it all starts with pills. And the fact is, as a result of healthcare and access to pills, for whatever reason the residents of Ocean County have access to it. \"Bottom line is, when you can't get the pills anymore, it ends up going to heroin and other drugs. But I'm not so sure we can clearly determine why Ocean County.\" Coronato's term as prosecutor is up on March 22. He was nominated by Christie, a Republican, and it remains to be seen whether he will be reappointed with a new Democratic governor in office. Among those arrested and charged with distributing drugs and weapons offenses were Jihad Anderson, 38, of Brick; Laquan Anderson,33, of Parlin; Lorenzo Balmer of Piscataway; Reynard Bronson, 34, of Newark; Sean Crosby, 35, of Lakewood; Gregory Delarosa, 38, of Jersey City; Bernard Mendez, of Lakewood; Robert Randolph, 36, Howell; Christopher Romero, 28, Lakewood; Byron Simpson, 46, of Plainfield. (A complete list of those arrested and their mugshots can be found in the photo gallery above) Three suspects remain at large, Coronato said.

South Daytona police Lt. Mark Cheatham said the suicidal man, Chad Murray, 31, was shot once in the incident that occurred at 8:21 a.m. at the Bristol Bay Apartments at 419 Banana Cay Drive and his injuries did not appear life-threatening. Cheatham said he could not immediately confirm where Murray was hit by the gunfire. Police were called by Murray's ex-girlfriend, Debra Sinniger, who reported that Murray was threatening to commit suicide by overdosing on medication because his relationship with the woman fell apart, Cheatham said. Sinniger told police Murray may be armed with a knife. When officers arrived at the apartment, Sinniger let them in and Murray immediately confronted the officers and charged at them while armed with the knife, Cheatham said. One officer deployed his department Taser, which did not stop Murray, so another officer was forced to fire his duty weapon to stop Murray, Cheatham said. Even after Murray was shot, officers had to wrestle a combative Murray to the ground. After a brief struggle, the officers secured Murray in handcuffs and were able to get immediate medical attention to him, Cheatham said. \"The injury Mr. Murray sustained from the incident does not appear to be life-threatening at this time,\" Cheatham said. \"He was transported to Halifax Medical Center for treatment.\" Murray was wanted on a Miami warrant on a charge of resisting an officer with violence. South Daytona police charged Murray on Saturday with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Cheatham said. The officer\u2019s name is not being released at this time due to an ongoing investigation by Florida Department of Law Enforcement, being assisted by the Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office.

A Gainesville woman who tried to rob another woman of her car Monday afternoon was fought off and instead stole a nearby Culligan delivery truck, spilling bottles out the back as she sped away, police say. The woman later was caught after a high-speed chase on Interstate 75. Monday\u2019s incident began at 3:30 p.m., the Gainesville Police Department reported, when a woman was walking to her car with her groceries in the Winn-Dixie parking lot on Southwest 16th Avenue.

Police, who had retreated to the ground floor, ordered the woman to drop the gun, but she did not. One officer fired four to five shots, and the woman staggered and fell down the stairs. Officials have not said how many shots hit the woman or where she was struck. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where she died from her injuries.

She was afraid the robber might kill her away from family in a Place where her body might not be found. \"She said, 'If he is going to kill me, he's going to do it around my people,'\" the aunt said. On the way over, the robber took $14 in cash that was in the niece's vehicle. The robber hid his pistol underneath his clothing when he went inside the apartment and seemed to try to chat up an older male relative who was present, witnesses said. The niece woke her aunt, who said she quickly rushed up front, pushed the robber out of her apartment, locked the front door and called authorities. \"I was scared,\" the aunt said. \"I don't now.

(Published Tuesday, March 13, 2018) The mother of a suspected vehicle burglar said she's outraged police are not pursuing charges against the El Cajon homeowner who fatally shot her son. Early Sunday morning, an El Cajon resident said he shot someone he believed was breaking into his truck. In the midst of a confrontation, the homeowner said he fired off several shots from a .357 revolver style handgun. El Cajon police said the burglar was shot but escaped in another stolen truck he had driven to the crime scene on Chase Avenue. Suspect Joseph Mecurio then crashed into a home near Mona Place and died. \"Just because you break into someone's car, doesn't mean you can be killed,\" said Mecurio's mother, Monika Anderson. But former District Attorney, now a Criminal Defense Attorney, Paul Pfingst said unbeknownst to the majority of the public, California law says you can actually be killed just for breaking into someone's car. \"In the state of California, you are allowed to defend your property. You've worked for your property,\" Pfingst said. \"A person's car could be critical to their livelihood and you don't have to let someone steal your property. You're allowed to stop them.\" Pfingst said that includes using deadly force if the attempted burglary or other crime a person is trying to stop is a felony. Whether or not the break-in attempt was a felony could be a question El Cajon police are trying to answer in their investigation. Lt. Walt Miller said there is no indication a second suspect was involved in the incident. But, Mercurio brought a stolen vehicle to the scene, and it's unclear whether he intended to leave it there. If Mercurio were trying to steal homeowner, Michael Po's truck, it would be a felony. But, if he were only trying to break into it, that could be a misdemeanor. Police said a confrontation ensued between the two men when the homeowner, Po, tried to stop Mercurio from breaking into his truck. If Mercurio threatened Po with any violence, that brings his actions back up to a felony, no matter what his intentions were with Po's truck. \"He's never been violent in his entire life,\" his mother Monika Anderson said. Anderson said her son is a heroin addict and was probably looking for drugs or money in the truck to steal. Anderson would not say how or why she suspects that. She said Mercurio has been trying to get sober since his twin brother overdosed in 2011 and has been in and out of eight rehab centers. \"He wanted to get sober so bad,\" she said. Anderson said Mercurio was the best son anyone could hope for and leaves behind a 6-year-old daughter. Pfingst said the bottom line is the law protects property owners and places the risk for criminal activity on the criminals. \"If someone wants to steal your property and it's felony property, you don't have to run away,\" Pfingst said. \"And you don't have to let them walk away with your property. You're allowed to fight and defend your property and you're allowed to use deadly force to do it under the law.\" El Cajon police have said it is unlikely charges will be filed against Po. NBC 7 investigated Mercurio's criminal history, finding no convictions for violent crimes, as his mother said. Mercurio was charged with a handful of felony and misdemeanor drug and paraphernalia possession charges, along with DUI charges between 2005 and 2014.

Bevan Wilson Bevan Lester Wilson was arraigned on charges of assault with intent to murder, assault with a dangerous weapon and felony firearm. He was given a $45,000 cash or surety bond by Magistrate Elisha Fink. Wilson was near tears after Fink set the bond. \"I was the one who called,\" he said, apparently referring to contacting police. \"I am the victim. I can assure you I'm not a flight risk or a danger to the public.\" Fink did not allow Wilson to elaborate on what was meant by asserting he was the victim. Wilson appeared aggrieved and confused throughout the arraignment, which took Place via video at the Washtenaw County Service Center. He said he is a former electrician who is now self-employed running a company that buys and resells office furniture. Wilson says he is married and that his wife works. Fink appointed him a public defender and set a preliminary examination for March 4. Wilson is accused of firing off a round at Ben Clink, who was plowing snow Tuesday morning at Valley Ranch Apartments, located in the 1400 block of Oak Valley Drive of Pittsfield Township. Four inches of the white stuff fell Monday night and early Tuesday morning. Clink works for the private company contracted to remove snow from the apartment complex. Clink told The Ann Arbor News he had been plowing the lot since 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. Later that morning, about 7:30 a.m., Clink said he made a temporary pile of snow behind a white car. He added he fully intended to move the snow pile as soon as he could. Police say the car belonged to Wilson's wife and that Wilson, upset that the snow pile was preventing him from moving the car, came out and confronted Wilson with a handgun. Wilson has a conceal pistol license, according to police. Wilson fired a shot that struck the front window of the front-loader Clink was driving, police said. Clink remembers ducking down behind the wheel of his vehicle as far as he could as a round struck the upper driver\u2019s side corner of the window. The man then continued to approach the vehicle while Clink pleaded with him not to shoot again. \u201cI was just saying \u2018Please don\u2019t shoot me, please don\u2019t shoot me, I\u2019ll move the snow, please don\u2019t shoot me,\u2019\u201d Clink said.

Raymond James Roberts, 39, was arrested on four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as well as six counts of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon. Roberts served just over two years of a three-year sentence for selling cocaine and was released in March 2012. He also served a year in 2007 for possession and sale of cocaine and has county arrest records dating back to 2004. More recently, Roberts was arrested on three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in October 2016 and for domestic battery and drugs in August 2009. He was not prosecuted on the assault charge. Thursday's standoff began after police responded to a domestic dispute at 8:12 p.m. Earlier in the day, police responded to reports of a man who had attempted to strike a store employee at the Bethune Village Market, 835 Drive Mary McLeod Bethune Boulevard The officer who responded to that call reported that he made contact with a man and issued verbal commands, but the suspect \"began to pull on the handle of a firearm from his right front pocket,\" the report stated. The suspect, later identified as Roberts, told police \"I got eight shots,\" and \"I'm ready to die today, let's get it,\" before pulling a long gun out of his vehicle. Attempts to talk Roberts down failed. Police said Roberts fled in a black Chevy Equinox. Another officer spotted and attempted to stop the vehicle, but the Roberts failed to stop and pursuit was terminated at the intersection of Mason Avenue and Pinewood Street, the report stated. During a subsequent investigation at the store, during which officers reviewed security footage, a domestic violence call was placed by Ethel Jackson who said her nephew had threatened her with a rifle. Streets were blocked while SWAT and hostage negotiators attempted to communicate with Roberts, who police described as having a \"violent history and is currently in an agitated state.\" The Daytona Beach Police Department is involved in a standoff with a suspect that is armed with a long gun at 1401 Forrest Avenue.

Jackson, still on the phone with dispatchers, was advised to stay hidden in a bedroom after Roberts entered the house. Eventually, Roberts peacefully complied and was taken into custody without incident. Jackson told police that Roberts' behavior had gotten progressively more hostile since his grandmother\u2019s death. Roberts' grandmother, who died last May, is the listed owner of the home where the standoff occurred at 1401 Forest Avenue She said that on Thursday Roberts had advised her was moving out, began to collect his belongings and then \u201cexited his bedroom holding a long-barreled shotgun with both hands and a revolver sticking out of his right front pocket,\u201d the report stated.

It is believed that the 7-year-old boy knew the gun was in a small locked safe in a closet and knew where the keys were kept, the news release states. To reach the safe, the child moved a dining room chair to the closet. He removed the gun from the safe and allegedly shot his dad. He could not provide a reason for shooting his dad, police said. The round went through the father\u2019s upper chest and back, into the mattress, through a wall next to the mattress, skipping across the floor of the living room, and through an exterior wall. The single round fired did not damage anything or anyone outside of the residence, police said. The father was flown by Native Air to John C. Lincoln Hospital in Phoenix where he remains in ICU in stable condition. The incident is still under investigation. \u201cGun safety can never be taken for granted,\u201d said Jerry Ferguson, PVPD spokesperson. \u201cEven when we think we\u2019ve secured our weapons, there is more to consider than just a weapon being locked up.

The Lee County jury found Fernandez guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of marijuana and possession of a controlled substance, the prescription drug Alprazolam. Fernandez also pleaded no contest last week to the charge of driving on a suspended license. On April 20th, 2014, when Lee County deputies stopped Fernandez for an alleged traffic violation in Fort Myers Beach, they detected the scent of marijuana wafting out of his car. Then, when a deputy instructed Fernandez to step out of his vehicle, a loaded handgun fell of his pocket. Deputies searched Fernandez and found the marijuana and Alprazolam, the drug commonly known as Xanax, in his shorts. Fernandez testified on Friday in his own defense. On the stand, he admitted to possessing the marijuana and prescription pills, but he denied that there was ever a weapon in his shorts. He argued that the arresting deputy, who found the handgun at Fernandez's feet, was incorrect in assuming that the handgun must have come from Fernandez. After two and a half days of trial, the six-member jury deliberated for about an hour. Fernandez was remanded into custody until his sentencing date in September. He faces up to 15 years in prison. Fernandez's attorney, James Stanton, declined to give his reaction to Tuesday's guilty verdict. \"I'm going to reserve any and all comments until after the sentencing,\" Stanton said. Prosecutor Brenda Wade also declined to comment. Christopher Corey (Photo: Submitted) It remains uncertain if Fernandez will face charges in the Collier County killing.

Michelle Batten, a spokesperson in the Collier County Sheriff's Office, would say only that, \"I believe it's still an active investigation.\" Fernandez's attorney said he was not aware of the Collier County case.

Morris had been charged with first degree murder, but his trial ended in a hung jury, and prosecutors offered him the manslaughter plea in order to avoid a re-trial that would have been emotionally difficult for Corey's family. Morris is now serving a 17-year prison sentence. A co-conspirator in the killing, Mallory McCann, was inside Corey\u2019s residence when the two men broke into the house. She had sent text messages to Fernandez at 3 a.m. to let him know the home\u2019s front door was unlocked, according to evidence at Morris' trial. McCann is now serving a 15-year prison sentence after a January plea agreement on robbery with a firearm. McCann testified at Morris' trial, saying that Morris and Fernandez planned to steal drugs and money from Corey. McCann testified that she heard Morris and Fernandez discussing later how Fernandez had carried out the shooting. In February 2014, Fernandez told a Naples Daily News reporter via Facebook that was not involved in the killing. \"Of the mistakes I have made, I had nothing to do with the murder of a Marine and his dog,\" wrote Fernandez.

Four firearms and 267 rounds of ammunition were ordered removed from a 56-year-old Lighthouse Point man who was determined to be a potential risk to himself or others. The guns and ammunition have been temporarily removed from the man under the state\u2019s new \u201crisk protection\u201d law, which is also sometimes called \u201cred flag\u201d legislation, Lighthouse Point City Attorney Michael Cirullo confirmed. The man was also taken to a hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment under the state\u2019s Baker Act. But the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under the new legislation \u2014 which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward\u2019s Chief Judge Jack Tuter. The man is also prohibited from trying to purchase or obtain guns or ammunition from any source. The legislation is part of a bill signed one week ago by Gov. Rick Scott. The new laws impose some restrictions on gun sales and give law enforcement new power to take action when they have evidence that a person may pose a danger. The National Rifle Association immediately filed a lawsuit in federal Court in Tallahassee challenging some aspects of the law, including the legality of banning gun sales to people under the age of 21. \u201cWe put the safety of our residents first,\u201d said Lighthouse Point Mayor Glenn Troast. \u201cThis is not about the Second Amendment and it\u2019s not about the NRA. We need commonsense gun laws and this is a commonsense gun law that gives police officers new tools they need to help us protect our community.\u201d The small city lies 14 miles east of Parkland where 34 people were shot \u2014 17 of whom died \u2014 in the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Before now, officials who attempted to remove guns from a person they thought was a danger could be removed from office and fined up to $5,000, the mayor said. Troast said he grew up in a law enforcement family, hunted with guns and has a healthy respect for firearms and gun rights. Lighthouse Point police made the request on March 14, one week after they were called to conduct a welfare check on the man, who they said was behaving strangely at his condominium building. Authorities said it was the latest in a series of encounters law enforcement had with the man, though he has no prior history of arrests in Florida. He had some prior arrests in Pennsylvania, records show. Police were called after the man turned off the main electrical breakers to the condo building in Lighthouse Point, Court records show. The South Florida Sun Sentinel is not identifying the man because of his medical condition. The man told officers he \u201cwas being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in [his] building,\u201d the judge wrote in his order. \u201c[He] could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor [can] \u2018shape shift, he can change heights and I\u2019m not sure where he comes from\u2019 and \u2018to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.\u2019\u201d He also told officers that he had to turn off the electrical breakers because \u201cthey are electrocuting me through my legs.\u201d Officers said they saw weapons in his home after they were called to check on his welfare. They also found evidence he had \u201ca voluminous amount of notes containing numerous references to former President Barack Obama, that he was killed in the 1980s but came back and now murders children to Place their spirits into [the man\u2019s] head, is a member of [al-Qaida], and is [the man\u2019s] enemy,\u201d the judge wrote in his order. The man was involuntarily committed for treatment in a separate proceeding and it is not yet known when he would be eligible for release, records show. The man did not attend the initial hearing, which temporarily removes his access to guns, because he is hospitalized. The guns that were temporarily seized were a Ruger LCP .380 pistol, an M2 Mauser .45 pistol, a Charter Arms .357 mag snub nose revolver and a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun, according to the Court order. Authorities have also begun the process of notifying federal and state authorities, as required by the law, so that the issue would be flagged if the man attempts to purchase a gun. Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata said officers have had interactions with the man over a number of years but none of them had risen to the level that would have warranted removing the man\u2019s access to guns. There was also no legal method to do so in the past. \u201cI think this is what the general public has been looking for \u2014 for law enforcement to be able to intervene in these kinds of situations \u2014 for a long time,\u201d the chief said. He said he wished he had such legislation a couple of years ago when another city resident was involuntarily committed for psychiatric help after a domestic incident and police took his guns for safekeeping. A very short time after the man was released from hospital, he demanded the return of his firearms. Police were still concerned for his well-being and the safety of others. Officers eventually agreed to release the guns to a family member, Licata said. Licata said he anticipates other communities around the state will soon file their own requests as issues arise in their own communities. \u201cThis may be the first but it\u2019s certainly not going to be the last,\u201d he said. Under the requirements of the state law, Lighthouse Point police, Cirullo and the man whose guns were removed are due in Court on March 28 for a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year.", "publish_date": "2018-03-16"}, {"text": "CRESTVIEW \u2013 A man dressed in black who kept tapping the front of his pants was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon.

There are concerns about Eldon Huffman's health and how a long trial might affect it, Huffman's lawyer, Eric White, said Monday, May 11. A hearing, once set for last week, was scheduled for Monday and a trial was to begin June 1. New dates have not been set. White said the lawyers and Circuit Judge Thomas Wilson will await medical clearances from Huffman's doctor or doctors. Huffman, 65, is accused of open murder for shooting his son, Jared Hufffman, on Jan. 22, 2014 inside the trailer they were sharing on Ken Drive in Spring Arbor Township. Jared Huffman died the following day. The older Huffman contends he acted in self-defense against a man White said has hurt him in the past, and White argues the case should be dismissed. Huffman is free from jail on a personal recognizance bond, rare in a murder case, and has been in and out of the hospital with a myriad of medical issues, White said. At issue Monday was to be whether White could call Jackson County Prosecutor Jerry Jarzynka and others in the prosecutor's office as witnesses in the case. Jarzynka wrote a letter and sent it to Blackman-Leoni Township public safety Director Michael Jester after a sergeant for the townships, Christopher Boulter, wrote a report supporting the defense theory of the case. Boulter was not involved in the initial investigation, handled by the Michigan State Police, and Jester has since removed him from the detective bureau, where Boulter had been for about 10 years, and returned him to Road patrol. Jester took issue with White's characterization of the move as a demotion and said it was a reassignment. Supervisors may be rotated at the director's discretion, he said. Jarzynka's letter, copied to Boulter, contained no explicit requests or threats and he said any personnel decisions are made at Jester's sole authority. Huffman was arrested in January 2014. A state police detective subsequently testified he was skeptical of parts of Eldon Huffman's self-defense account. Huffman, who was not seriously hurt, had told the detective his son hit him with various weapons and Eldon Huffman took a handgun out of his pocket and told his son to stop. When Jared Huffman started swinging again, Eldon Huffman said he shot him in the leg, according to earlier testimony. An unarmed Jared Huffman started to hobble toward a back bedroom and laundry area, where police later found guns, and Huffman shot him again, hitting him in the back of the head. A first trial began in September, but Wilson declared a mistrial because state police had information that had not been provided to White or the prosecution.", "publish_date": "2015-05-11"}, {"text": "Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

She thought their behavior was suspicious so she called police, Costantino said. While on the phone with police, the woman got into her car and began following the trio. Once the three were near the intersection of East Broad Street and Kipling Street near the Circle K Store, the men began punching and kicking a 43-year-old Bell Avenue man. \u201cThis woman slammed on her brakes, started honking her horn and told the men she was on the phone with the police,\u201d Costantino said. \u201cThis was enough to stop the attack and they took off running across Kipling toward the (shuttered) Elyria fire station back toward Sumner.\u201d As officers arrived, a second 911 call was received about a possible carjacking in the area, but Costantino said the incident was actually the attacked man who ran into the Sreett and attempted to jump into a passing car to flee his attackers. \u201cThe car was locked and the person did not stop,\u201d Costantino said.

The shootings occurred about 75 minutes and a half-mile apart late Sunday. The first was just before 10 p.m. in the 3600 block of Reisterstown Road in the Park Circle neighborhood. A man was shot in the head and died at a hospital a short time later, police said. At 11:15 p.m., police were dispatched to a shooting in the 3900 block of Edgewood Road in the East Arlington neighborhood. The victim had been shot several times and died at a hospital before midnight, police said. Police did not identify either of the victims or provide a possible motive. The incidents capped a weekend that saw eight people shot across the city, three of them fatally. Among the victims was 28-year-old Ricky Mellerson, who was found shot early Saturday in a vehicle that flipped over while traveling through Mount Vernon on East Madison Street. Police confirmed Monday that Mellerson was leaving the Casablanca Hookah Lounge in the 800 block of Guilford Avenue when the shooting occurred and that a female passenger was in the overturned vehicle. No additional details were provided and no arrests have been made. Three people were also stabbed early Sunday after a melee at a downtown club. Police Department data shows that even amid the spate of killings, other crime is down considerably to start the year. Robberies through Jan. 11 were down 49 percent, with 69 robberies compared with 135 at the same time last year. The statistics show aggravated assaults were down 23 percent, burglaries were down 23 percent, and larcenies were down 39 percent.

The Haines City Police Department accused Perez of committing armed burglary with assault, aggravated battery, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and shooting into an occupied vehicle. Police Chief James Elensky said Perez, who previously had been sentenced for burglary to an occupied dwelling and grand theft, is a known Sur 13 gang member.

The witness told Torres to wait while help arrived and the injured man drove off, according to the detective's report. Torres arrived at the hospital with a single gunshot wound to the hip, according to the report. Torres was initially uncooperative while he was in a tremendous amount of pain, Elensky said, but agreed to cooperate with police Monday. A warrant for Perez's arrest was issued at around 5 p.m. Monday. According to the detective, based on Torres' testimony, Perez and Torres agreed to meet in a parking lot to talk. When Torres arrived, Perez opened the passenger-side door carrying an AK-47 rifle and pointed the weapon at Torres. Torres said he pushed the rifle barrel down, Perez fired, and the round struck Torres in the hip. The detective discovered a burn mark on the passenger side of the blood-covered center console. The bullet traveled through the console, clipped the safety belt buckle and struck Torres in the hip. Perez fled after the shot was fired, according to the testimony, and Torres exited the car to close the passenger door and then drove to the hospital, with a brief stop to ask for help. Torres is expected to survive his wounds, Elensky said, and has been through one surgery and will go through another because the gunshot caused a lot of damage and left a number of bullet fragments. Perez is not in any of the places he is usually known to be, Elensky added, and the department is looking for tips regarding his whereabouts.

Molina's previous record as an adult involved lesser crimes such as fleeing police or providing false identification, he said. As a juvenile, he faced a felony charge, but the judge told him not to say anything more about that during the arraignment. Molina, wearing a blue and gray sweatshirt, black jeans and red and black high-top sneakers, said he's lived in the apartment for 17 years with his parents. He said he works 60 hours a week as a dishwasher at Aman's Indian Bistro on Route 248 in Lower Nazareth Township. He also coached local softball for three years. A man who answered the phone Thursday morning at the restaurant declined to confirm if Molina worked there, saying he would run it by a manager. Molina called the drug crimes \"just a mistake\" and said his previous run-ins with the law \"sound worse on paper than they are.\" Those types of crimes on Molina's record concerned Yetter because they could indicate a risk of not showing up for the preliminary hearing, tentatively scheduled 9 a.m. April 9 in the same court, the judge said. But Molina said he hadn't missed Court appearances in the past. Yetter told Molina that the Wilson Borough Court has been giving six-figure bails in similar drug cases \"because I don't want folks getting out while this is pending and reselling.\" A moment later, Yetter set bail at $150,000 and several minutes after that, Molina was taken to Northampton County Prison.

There have been more than 20 similar incidents reported in Dallas since the beginning of the year. Janie Gomez and her husband pulled up to their Oak Cliff home around eight o\u2019clock Sunday night, with two of their grandchildren in tow. As soon as Gomez opened the passenger side door a young woman forced the door open, put a gun to her face and demanded her purse. \u201cIt\u2019s the element of surprise,\u201d Gomez recalled. \u201cI guess I was panicked and I looked like I was trying to fight and she told me \u2018Don\u2019t fight me. Don\u2019t fight me!\u2019 and I was scared that the gun would go off.\u201d Gomez did not have her purse with her and to prove it, she told the suspect she was going to turn on the light in their van so she could see for herself. When the light turned on, her 4-year-old grandson caught a glimpse of the suspect and the gun and began to cry. \u201cShe said, \u2018Be quiet, baby. Be quiet, baby,\u2019 trying to calm him down,\u201d Gomez said. Meanwhile, a second suspect, a young male, threatened Gomez\u2019s husband with a knife. \u201cHe said, \u2018My partner got a gun on your wife, you need to hand over your wallet.\u2019\u201d Gomez\u2019s husband complied with the robber\u2019s directions and the suspects ran and got into a light-colored SUV parked a few houses down. The suspects got away with credit cards, a driver\u2019s license, passport and cash. While Gomez\u2019s priority is helping her grandson forget the incident, she hopes her story helps others become more aware of the potential danger lurking outside their own homes. \u201cMy fear is that one of these days, they may get desperate and shoot someone.\u201d Suspect descriptions vary in many of the robberies, so police don\u2019t think they are all connected. Dallas police are urging residents to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times. If you notice any suspicious activity, call 911 immediately.

According to a report, drug officials were looking into illegal drug activity connected to Xavier Santiago and decided to investigate. On Friday, agents who went to Santiago\u2019s residence, knocked on the door and while waiting outside, noticed someone was looking through the blinds. Agents said they smelled an odor of marijuana coming from the home and continued knocking. Although a dog was heard barking inside, no one came to door. A man, later identified as Santiago, was seen peeping out of a window. Santiago refused to come outside, despite agents knocking on the door. When Santiago finally opened the door, agents said they smelled marijuana and detained him. Santiago declined to give agents permission to search his home so drug officials had to get a search warrant. Santiago\u2019s children told drug officials that their father had given them money and it was hidden in their pockets. Santiago told drug officials in an interview that he did not want to open the door because he had been robbed by people posing as cops several years ago. Agents asked him how much marijuana was in the home and he told them a pound. They asked him if he had been flushing drugs down the toilet instead of answering the door and he told them no. With the search warrant, officials found the steroids, drugs, guns and drug paraphernalia inside the residence. They also found clumps of marijuana floating in two toilet bowls. Santiago faces several charges including tampering with evidence, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of an anabolic steroid. He was released early Saturday morning on an $18,000 bond. State records show Santiago has had several convictions such as drug possession and giving false name to a law enforcement official.

Police were called to the scene at 9:09 a.m. for a burglary, and when they arrived, they found that a \"male offender\" who had been trying to commit a burglary had been shot by the homeowner, said Police News Affairs Sgt. Antoinette Ursitti. The 44-year-old homeowner was sleeping when his frightened 18-year-old daughter woke him up, then told him that she heard noises and thought someone was breaking into the apartment behind theirs, according to a police report. At first she thought the noise was a heater in that apartment but after she heard something fall, she locked the door that separates the two residences, the report said. The man \"grabbed both of his crutches and walked over and unlocked and opened the door,'' the report said. He did not see anyone at first, so he returned to his bedroom to get his gun. When he went back to the rear apartment, he saw two intruders \"charging towards\" him so he shot at them, according to the report. Both burglars stopped, turned around and ran back towards the back door, but one of them collapsed and fell to the floor. Two men were seen running away and yelling gang slogans and the 44-year-old told his daughter to call 911. Responding officers found the back door of the rear apartment had been pried with a metal shovel and found shell casings on the kitchen floor, the report said. During the course of the investigation, police learned the 44-year-old homeowner's Firearm Owners Identification card was expired and he was charged with one count of possessing a firearm with an expired FOID card, a misdemeanor, police said. Viramontes lived in the 2100 block of West Cermak Road, about two blocks from the break-in, officials said. An autopsy is scheduled for later today.

Inside the residence, police discovered around 11,500 bags of heroin, approximately 65 grams of cocaine and over $6,000 in cash. Investigators said the heroin seized is worth approximately $58,000 in Hampshire County. Police also found a loaded, unlocked .380-caliber Llama pistol at the house.

The teen suffered a bloody lip and earlobe during the attack, an arrest affidavit stated. One of her earrings was ripped out, according to the Sheriff's Office. Deputies responded to the accuser's Deltona home shortly after 1:10 a.m. Friday and met with her and her parents. The teen told deputies that Chapman, who had been violent toward her in the past, had broken into her bedroom earlier that morning, according to the affidavit. The woman told deputies she was awakened by the sound of him entering through a window, at which time he threw her onto the floor and began removing her clothes and his.

During her interview with the Sheriff's Office, the accuser said Chapman \"was known to carry a firearm,\" detectives said. Nothing in the arrest affidavit or accompanying reports indicated the accuser actually saw Chapman with a gun. A screen and board that had been covering one of the windows to the house had been removed and were lying on the ground when deputies arrived, the affidavit stated. The accuser was administered a sexual assault exam after she was transported to Halifax Health in Deltona, authorities said. A sheriff's sergeant was responding to the accuser's house when he got the call about the suspect's possible location. He headed there and he and other deputies set up a perimeter at the suspect's house on Gainesville Drive, according to the affidavit. The suspect's mother told deputies her son was inside the garage sleeping and that's where they found him, wearing only a pair of jeans. Deputies said Chapman had left some of his clothes at the accuser's house. Chapman told arresting deputies that he had a rifle on his wall and possibly a gun under his mattress. Deputies said they searched under the mattress and found a loaded magazine. Chapman then told deputies his gun was inside the glove box of his car, they said. During an interview with a detective, Chapman said the sex he had with the accuser was consensual, according to the Sheriff's Office. Afterward, he refused to answer any additional questions and requested an attorney, deputies said. A review of Chapman's arrest record shows he was charged with sexual battery in February 2016, but the case was not prosecuted. Information about that case was not available Saturday. He was also arrested on charges of battery and child abuse causing great harm or disability in May 2014. A petition for injunction for protection also was filed in May 2014, but the order was denied without a hearing.

The teenager, who has yet to be charged, told detectives he was \"holding\" a revolver and a shotgun for Banwart because Banwart had a felony conviction in an unrelated case and wasn't allowed to possess weapons. He said Banwart told him the weapons were stolen and that he purchased them from another rural Des Moines County youth in early December. He also told detectives he called Banwart and told him his mother found the revolver, but not the 20 gauge shotgun he hid in a barn. He informed detectives he told Banwart during the telephone call he placed the shotgun in a ditch near his home in rural Des Moines County. He said Banwart retrieved the shotgun from the ditch shortly after the phone call, Court records indicate.

In one Des Moines County burglary alone on O'Connell Beach Road, thieves took 11 firearms, including shotguns, rifles and handguns. The dollar amount of the stolen property in Des Moines County has not been released. However, authorities said it appeared to be several thousands of dollars. In Henderson County, the thieves broke into 20 cabins and homes on New Year\u2019s weekend, stealing thousands of dollars worth of electronic equipment and guns.

Gang members were standing in front of a residence known to police on the 2300 block of Lemur Street when members from a rival gang drove up in a blue Nissan Sentra around 8:23 p.m., sparking an argument and then a gunfight, said Santa Rosa Police Lt. John Cregan. \u201cThis was solely a gang rivalry,\u201d Cregan said of the motive behind the shootings. Juan Angel Rivera, 19, of Santa Rosa was hit by gunfire in the head while inside the Sentra and was rushed to Sutter Santa Rosa Hospital, where his gang mates dumped his unresponsive body on the sidewalk before driving away, Cregan said. He died of his wounds Friday, marking the first homicide in Santa Rosa city limits this year. Another 19-year-old man who lived in the Lemur Street home, just north of Highway 12, was shot in the arm but not seriously injured, Cregan said. He was taken by others at the scene to the Sutter hospital in a Chevrolet Camaro, which was tailed to the hospital by police, who said the driver refused to stop. The occupants were detained by officers when it arrived at the hospital. The hospital was placed on lockdown and the two shooting victims were transported to another facility for treatment, said Sutter Health spokesman Shaun Ralston. The man who survived was released from treatment by Friday morning, Cregan said. He was not arrested. Police on Thursday night obtained a search warrant and detained multiple people from the Lemur Street home and brought them in for questioning, Cregan said. One gun was found in front of the house and another inside. On Friday about 1:10 p.m., detectives with the gang unit, acting on a separate search warrant, detained nine people in a SWAT action at a home in the 4300 block of Stony Point Road. The home, about 4 miles south of the Lemur Street residence, was identified as a law enforcement target after a blue Nissan Sentra with bullet holes was spotted outside, Cregan said. Two firearms were found in the home, he said. No arrests were reported as of Friday evening, and no suspects from the Lemur Street home were in custody, Cregan said. People from the Stony Point home were detained and being interviewed by detectives, he said. Police were still trying to determine the number of shooters and shots fired. \u201cThis is a complicated case where rival gang members shot at each other,\u201d Cregan said.

Eugene Taylor, 26, of Clementon, appeared before Superior Court Judge Charles Delehey on Thursday at the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly for a bench trial so the judge could determine his competence when the incident occurred. According to comments in court, Delanco police officer Francisco Ambrifi responded to a 911 call about 3:45 a.m. on May 14, 2013, reporting a man who was possibly under the influence screaming in the area of Delaware Avenue. Taylor allegedly appeared \"zoned out\" and in a \"religiously-disoriented state\" and made comments that \"you're going to see Jesus tonight,\" Delehey read from accounts of the incident. The judge noted that he was not making any finding of fact, but rather simply summarizing what was alleged to have happened. After the officer sprayed Taylor with mace there was a scuffle and Taylor was shot four times and the officer once in the leg with his own weapon. Court documents indicated that Taylor was alleged to have jumped in front of Ambrifi's patrol car. In 2015, Taylor filed a civil lawsuit against Ambrifi, the municipality and others in U.S. District Court in Camden that is still pending, according to Court records. In the suit, Taylor alleged that Ambrifi was not properly trained and had used excessive force against him during the altercation. Taylor, who has been in jail since June 2013, had lost an appeal in July to have the indictment dismissed because the grand jury did not consider his mental issues. A psychological evaluation determined that Taylor is schizophrenic and family and friends said he became obsessed with religion and even death in the days before the incident, according to Court documents. A trial date had been set for January, but Taylor opted instead for the bench trial. Before Delehey ruled that Taylor was not guilty because he was mentally incapacitated during the incident, did not understand the nature of his conduct, and could not determine right from wrong, the state and defense agreed to certain conditions. Burlington County Assistant Prosecutor Thaddeus Drummond said the state agreed to dismiss all counts of the indictment, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, except for a third-degree offense of resisting arrest. That was the only offense considered by the judge during the trial. Also, both sides agreed that Taylor will be sent to a psychiatric facility under what is known as Krol status until June 2018 and will waive his right for two years after that to challenge any finding by mental health professionals that he continue to be committed if he is deemed a risk to himself or others.

MUKILTEO \u2014 Neighbors who witnessed a shootout in Mukilteo on Feb. 16 told investigators they saw the suspect level his gun at officers before police opened fire. Two men remained hospitalized this week in connection with the flurry of violence that day, which started with a double shooting on Camano Island and ended with a police chase and additional gunfire in Mukilteo. Riley Leif Ottersen, 34, is under investigation for eluding police, plus four counts of second-degree assault for allegedly aiming a gun at officers in Snohomish County, according to a search warrant filed in district court. The man also is being investigated for first-degree assault in Island County. Ottersen is accused of shooting two acquaintances on Camano Island and then leading police on a high-speed chase into Mukilteo. Of the two people who were shot on the island, one, a 44-year-old man, remains at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. The other, a woman, was treated and released for a gunshot wound. The victims were sitting in a car in the 500 block of Michelle Drive at about 3:15 p.m. when Ottersen reportedly approached the driver\u2019s side window and asked for cigarettes. One of them handed Ottersen a pack of cigarettes. Ottersen grabbed the pack and then \u201cpulled out a firearm and without warning or provocation shot (the male victim) in the head,\u201d detectives were told. The bullet went into the left side of the man\u2019s face and out the right side of his neck, according to Court papers. The same bullet went through the woman\u2019s arm. The victims\u2019 injuries were consistent with their statements, detectives wrote in a search warrant affidavit. The gunman then drove off in a 2001 Toyota Camry. Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies spotted the car a few miles away on Highway 532 near Stanwood. They attempted to pull Ottersen over but he took off eastbound, reaching speeds of 100 mph. The chase continued onto southbound I-5 at similar speeds. Ottersen reportedly was weaving through lanes and using the shoulder to pass. A Washington State Patrol trooper joined in the pursuit on I-5. An Everett police officer also joined as the chase wound westbound onto Highway 526 toward Mukilteo. During the chase, Ottersent reportedly called 911 and told the dispatcher he had shot someone in Stanwood. He said he was in a pursuit and he \u201cwould not stop,\u201d according to the warrant. He then drove into Mukilteo. At the intersection of 92nd Street SW and 53rd Avenue West, a deputy tried to ram the Camry to cause Ottersen to lose control, an effort known as a \u201cPIT maneuver.\u201d The PIT maneuver wasn\u2019t successful, and Ottersen continued northbound on 53rd Avenue West. While turning westbound on 88th Street SW, Ottersen lost control and the Camry went into a ditch. That was at about 3:50 p.m. Police caught up a few seconds later. Three neighbors heard the commotion and looked outside. The three reportedly told investigators that they saw Ottersen get out of his car and wait for officers to arrive. At first, Ottersen appeared to follow the officers\u2019 commands and put his hands up. Then he suddenly grabbed a handgun from his waist. All three witnesses said Ottersen pointed the gun at police, according to the warrant. The search warrant provides additional detail from the confusing conclusion of the chase. Shortly after the suspect\u2019s car was rammed, police-radio traffic captured officers reporting that shots were fired. Then the officers reported the suspect was at gunpoint. Seconds later, police again reported shots fired. They said the suspect was down and in need of medical aid. Investigators have not yet said whether Ottersen fired his weapon at the officers. As of Friday, he remained at Harborview. He is expected to face charges in Snohomish and Island counties. The Mukilteo shooting is being investigated by the Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team. The team includes detectives from around the county who probe cases where police use potentially fatal force. The SMART team sought a judge\u2019s permission to search the Toyota Camry for potential evidence. They especially were interested in Ottersen\u2019s cellphone and whether he still had the pack of cigarettes from Camano Island. Four officers who were involved in the Mukilteo gunfire.

Chief United States District Judge Terry L. Wooten sentenced Dowdy to 75 months imprisonment with 3 years of federal supervised release to follow. Evidence presented at the earlier change of plea hearing established that on January 3, 2014, Dowdy and another individual were involved in an altercation inside a convenience store on Farrow Road in Columbia. Evidence showed that during the altercation, Dowdy pulled a handgun and shot the other individual in the face. Dowdy then fled the scene. The incident was captured on videotape. The Columbia Police Department issued state warrants of attempted murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime (those state charges remain pending and Mr. Dowdy is innocent until proven guilty). Dowdy was apprehended in Orangeburg on January 14, 2014. At the time of his state arrest on January 14, 2014, Dowdy had a loaded .357 caliber handgun in his possession. The investigation revealed that the handgun was the same handgun used in the January 3, 2014, incident. Dowdy is prohibited under federal law from possessing firearms and/or ammunition based upon his prior state convictions for burglary 2nd degree (2 separate offenses) and attempted burglary 2nd degree.

Wagner announced. Eloy Gonzalez-Rocha was also charged with being a deported alien found in the United States. According to Court documents, on January 8, 2014, Fresno County Sheriff deputies investigated complaints about a strong smell of marijuana and various activities at a property in Dunlap in Fresno County. They found the brothers, who are undocumented, in a rented mobile home on the property. After obtaining a search warrant, narcotics detectives found 260 marijuana plants, more than 200 pounds of processed marijuana, $15,160 in cash, and three firearms, one of which was reported stolen from Arkansas and another having an obliterated serial number. Eloy Gonzalez-Ramirez had been deported from the United States nearly one year before he was found in Dunlap. Under federal law, illegal aliens are prohibited from possessing firearms. This case was the product of an investigation by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office, with assistance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Assistant United States Attorney Karen A. Escobar is prosecuting the case.

They are scheduled for arraignment and plea on the indictment on February 28, 2014. If convicted of the drug offenses, the defendants face a sentence of five to 40 years in prison and a $5 million fine. They face a maximum term of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for being illegal aliens in possession of firearms, and five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.

However, the attempted traffic stop turned into a high-speed chase through the city, Janke said. Dietrich rammed a West Fargo police vehicle during the pursuit, and he eventually stopped in the 1000 block of 11th Street West. There, he holed up in his pickup truck, and Janke said authorities believed there were weapons in the vehicle. At 10 p.m., the SWAT team took over negotiations with Dietrich. At 10:37 p.m., he got out of his truck, \"refused to follow commands, and posed an imminent deadly threat to the SWAT operators. Four SWAT operators fired at the suspect,\" according to a joint news release from Fargo and West Fargo officials. Dietrich was taken by ambulance to Sanford Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. It remains unclear why the officers saw Dietrich as \"an imminent deadly threat.\" West Fargo spokeswoman Melissa Richard said she could not confirm whether weapons were found in Dietrich's vehicle or whether he was armed when he was shot. Moorhead police and a representative of the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation directed all inquires about the shooting to West Fargo officials. Two of the SWAT team members who fired at Dietrich were identified as Sgts. Shane Aberle and Troy Hannig of the Fargo Police Department, according to North Dakota officials. Aberle has been with the Fargo Police Department for 15 years, and was promoted to the rank of sergeant in December 2013. In 2008, during a 20-hour standoff in Luverne, N.D., Aberle's helmet was hit by five shotgun pellets at close range. The shooter, Darin Dahl, was convicted of attempted murder and reckless endangerment, both felonies. Hannig has been with the Fargo Police Department for 10 years, and became a sergeant in January 2017. The Moorhead Police Department identified the two Minnesota-based SWAT team members who fired at Dietrich as Moorhead Officer Brandon Desautel and Clay County Deputy Kyle Diekmann. Desautel and Diekmann have each been with their respective agencies for four years. Their photos were not provided in compliance with Minnesota's data practices law, Moorhead police said in a news release. All four officers are on standard paid administrative leave. The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting. Felony charges Dietrich was set to appear in Cass County District Court on Wednesday, March 14, on a felony terrorizing charge. In that case, he was accused of threatening to kill his father at his father's south Fargo home on Oct. 24. According to Court documents, Dietrich was drinking heavily at his father's home and the two argued. The father told investigators he ran upstairs and retrieved his handgun, loaded a round into the chamber, and pointed the gun at his son. Dietrich grabbed the gun barrel and twisted it away. As he did so, a round was fired into a piece of furniture and the floor. The father said he again pointed the gun at his son and recocked it, and Dietrich said, \"Come on shoot me Dad \u2014 shoot me \u2014 I don't care anymore!\" according to Court documents. Dietrich and a woman left the house, but he returned later that night and was arrested on an outstanding warrant, Court documents said. In a separate case, Dietrich pleaded guilty in 2016 to a felony count of terrorizing in Cass County. Also, a Grand Forks County warrant had been issued for his arrest after he failed to appear in Court on charges of meth possession in December. 'All the chaos' Barry Nitzkorski, who lives at 1003 11th Street W. with his wife Donelle Nitzkorski, saw Dietrich damage his parked vehicles. \"The suspect came flying in, took out the mailbox, hit my wife's car and my company car. Police started drawing weapons,\" he said. \"We got the alert pretty quickly to go into lockdown.\" Nitzkorski said they heard Dietrich yelling and screaming inside his truck but none of what he said was understandable. Officers eventually escorted the Nitzkorskis out of their home, and the couple went to a relative's home about a mile away where they heard the gunshots that ended the standoff. Officers allowed the Nitzkorskis back inside their home to get overnight supplies, and the couple spent the night at a hotel with their puppy. \"It was amazing how well we were treated despite all the chaos,\" Donelle Nitzkorski said. The shooting occurred a block south of West Fargo's Westside Elementary School, which police used as a staging area during the standoff. Classes resumed as normal on Tuesday, March 13, said district spokeswoman Heather Konschak. Miranda Sorlie moved in three houses down from the Nitzkorskis in October. She and her son had left home just before 9 p.m. to run an errand and returned to find their Sreett blocked off and no information about what was happening. Sorlie circled the area and monitored news outlets to learn what was going on before she was finally able to return home after 1 a.m. Sorlie said it's concerning that police pursued Dietrich at such high speeds through what has been a quiet and peaceful residential area. \"It's a good thing this happened now in March,\" she said. \"If it would have been June, we for sure would have been outside. Everybody would have.\" A CodeRED phone alert was issued for the neighborhood on Monday night, and residents living within a quarter mile of 1003 11th Street W. were asked to shelter in place. However, not everyone received the alert. \"We're new to the area, so we didn't have CodeRed,\" said Julie Fraser, who lives nearby. \"Apparently you need to sign up for that if you don't have a landline.\" From her home, Fraser could see the vehicles that blocked Dietrich's truck as the standoff unfolded. \"The police did an amazing job, and we felt safe the entire time,\" she said. \"People need to remember, for the officers and the suspect's family, we need to pray for them because no one wants this to happen to their kid.\"", "publish_date": "2018-03-13"}, {"text": "3rd suspect arrested in Santa Rosa shooting Thomas Martinez, 19, was the third suspect arrested in connection with a Saturday shooting where the victim drove himself to a 7-Eleven to get help.

The suspect was struck and transported to UF hospital where he died,\" said JSO Sgt. Jay Farhat. \"We are currently interviewing the homeowner now.\" Sgt. Farhat told Channel 4 that the homeowner did not live in the home that was broken into, but owned the property. \"That was one of his rental houses and he spent the night there last night and was doing some work on the house and was actually about to leave when the break-in occurred,\" said Sgt. Farhat. At this time, police said, the shooting appeared to be justified and the homeowner is not being charged for the shooting. However, the homeowner was taken to jail Saturday, charged with a misdemeanor violation of injunction for having a firearm. \"It appears that there was an injunction for protection filed against him earlier sometime last year and the stipulation was he was not suppose to have a firearm on him.

He followed his wife to the U.S. looking to reconcile. But she was trying to escape what her family said had become a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship.

When her mother, Dorothy Yoder, heard she\u2019d bought a plane ticket to return to Florida in February, she knew the decision was for her children. \u201cShe hated to leave Germany. She had learned to love it,\u201d Yoder said Tuesday. \u201cShe loved the people and the church she had and the mountains. It was hard for her.\u201d Dan entered the U.S. on March 14. He was staying in Tallahassee but drove back and forth several times to Calhoun County to try and speak with his wife. She had been living at her brother\u2019s house on Dessie Stone Road just south of Blountstown for the past few weeks. On Thursday night, the couple discussed their pending divorce. The domestic dispute spilled over into Friday, and Judy's brother Robert Yoder reported hearing three gunshots outside of his home at about midnight. Then Judy was gone. Robert later told Calhoun County Sheriff's Office investigators Dan was visiting that night to try and convince his wife to call off their pending divorce. The couple sat around the dining room table talking. Dan left the room and a short time later, Robert noticed lights on in an adjoining mobile home on the property. He went to turn them off and when he was returning heard the gunshots, according to Court records. He told investigators he fled but saw Dan holding what he thought was a handgun. Dan pointed the gun at him and told him to run. Robert went back to the now empty house. He called 911 and heard a vehicle leave the house. By dawn, Dan showed up at the Jackson County Sheriff's Office in Marianna. Inside the trunk of a borrowed car was his wife's body. He surrendered to authorities holding the handgun he is suspected of shooting her with and was charged with first-degree murder. Devoted to family and faith Dan and Judy Belc married in Calhoun County in May 1993. Her Mennonite family has lived in the area since the mid-1950s. They remain deeply connected to the community. In 25 years the couple had six children, now ages 6 to 20. For the past decade, they lived in Germany. The two oldest are in college in Tallahassee. Judy was as devoted to her kids as she was to her faith. Her gentle and calm demeanor shone through her love for them. \u201cShe was one of the most patient mothers with her children and loved them so,\u201d her mother, Dorothy Yoder, said Tuesday before going to a viewing service for the family. \u201cShe really poured her heart and life into them.\u201d Judy was also an attentive wife, her mother said, even as the couple struggled in their marriage.

Yoder said her son-in-law was controlling and verbally abusive, but her daughter\u2019s faith kept her in Place during strife. \u201cShe wanted to be a biblical wife to her husband,\u201d Dorothy said. \u201cShe was very conscientious about her Christian life.\u201d But Dorothy Yoder never heard her daughter was being physically abused by her husband. But her daughter had asked one of her sons to hide a handgun when she moved back to Blountstown. Seeking help online Judy sought help through online communities dedicated to Christian women with large families and women struggling with difficult marriages. She confided in Melissa Carter, a Nova Scotia, Canada, woman, who worked as an administrator on several Facebook support groups. For the past three years, even though they never met in person, Carter and Judy stayed in constant contact via text and phone calls. They discussed the difficulties she and Dan were having and the abuse she was suffering.

He wanted her to call off the divorce. She was always careful about how to respond and shared the texts with her support group. \u201cShe very calmly and consistently said \u2018I cannot do that. I am doing this to protect our children,\u2019\u201d said Carter who since her friend's death has reviewed the messages. Judy urged her husband to stay in Germany and get help. She wanted nothing more than for him to turn to faith, Carter said. Buy Photo The church in Blountstown where a viewing was held for Judy Yoder Belc Tuesday.

It was started by Carter and is aimed at providing for the children being cared for now by Judy's family in the Tallahassee area. Call to the children A friend loaned the 1998 Toyota Camry to Dan Belc. He called their children and told them he\u2019d shot their mother and she was in the trunk of the car. He intended to commit suicide. Dan Belc, 49, is charged with the first-degree murder of his estranged wife, Judy Yoder Belc, 49.

At about 7 a.m. he did just that in neighboring Jackson County. He had blood on his face, hands and clothing. It was his wife's he told JCSO deputies. He said her body was in the trunk of the car. Dan told his son that his wife \u201cwould not listen to him in reference to their impending divorce,\u201d according to arrest papers from the Calhoun County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is investigating the killing. Dorothy Yoder said she isn\u2019t angry with her son-in-law. She isn\u2019t ready to see him yet but believes there is power in forgiveness. \u201cI don\u2019t like what he did,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cThere is a verse in the Bible where it says if we don\u2019t forgive (God) won\u2019t forgive us. He\u2019s been in the family and we care about him. We feel sorry for him.\u201d Her daughter\u2019s love for God has carried her to the peace she always sought, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s been tears shed and there\u2019s been many many people around the world praying for us and I think that has helped,\u201d Dorothy Yoder said. \u201cBut we do know that she had her heart toward God and is with him in glory and heaven.\u201d Contact Karl Etters at ketters@tallahassee.com or @KarlEtters on Twitter.

It just so happened that the victim was home alone inside her house asleep when someone sprayed the house with bullets. Some of the bullets went next door, striking the car in the driveway and the neighbor's front door. \"These two are under my daughter's bed,\" Antionne Nailor said as tears fell from his face just at the thought of his daughter possibly being in the path of gunfire. Antionne Nailor broke down crying while pointing out where the two bullets struck inside his daughter's bedroom and struck the girl's mother as she slept in their daughter's bed. \"She got hit in her back and in the back of her neck two shots,\" Nailor said. Their Maura Lane home is full of bullet holes after someone opened fire on the house just before 2 a.m. Since Antionne's daughter stayed at her grandmother's, the girl's mother stayed in her room for the night as Antionne picked up an extra shift at work. \"She got hit in my daughter's bed where she would have been that night,\" said Nailor. \"We all would have been here tonight. I only worked for somebody else and I didn't want to do it and if I would have been here, I would have been dead.\" There are bullet holes in the windows, the front door, and all over the front siding of Antionne's home. \"Now I have bullet holes - more than I can count,\" he said. \"More than I want to count.\" Some of the gunfire hit next door, striking the windshield of a 2010 Dodge Charger.

He's accused of shooting at a 24-year-old woman on Cedar Road. James Middleton served 13 years in prison for strangling his live-in girlfriend in 2000. CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio \u2014 A 55-year-old man convicted for killing his live-in girlfriend and stuffing her into a trunk in 2000 is facing charges that accuse him of shooting at a 24-year-old woman late Monday. James Middleton, of Cleveland Heights, was charged Tuesday in Cleveland Heights Municipal Court with second-degree felonious assault. Bond was set at $20,000 and a preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 25. Middleton, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend, a top administrator at the Cuyahoga County Community Mental Health Board, is accused of firing at least one shot at the woman out of the passenger seat of his nephew\u2019s car on Cedar Road. Middleton, reports say, is the uncle of the woman\u2019s children and was riding in the passenger seat with the father of the woman\u2019s child. One of the bullets struck the hood of her car, reports say. The woman told police she was driving about 11:40 p.m. near Rossmoor Road from a friend\u2019s home, when a dark colored Chevrolet sedan pulled up next to her car. She told police she recognized the driver as Middleton\u2019s 30-year-old nephew, who is the father of her children. She told police Middleton stuck a handgun out his window and shot at least one time at her. The woman and the 30-year-old man exited their cars and argued in the street, reports say. The woman then drove to the police department. Investigators searched her car and noted the bullet hole. Middleton was released from prison Jan. 15, 2013 after serving a 13-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the middle of his trial. In December, Middleton won a pro se appeal in the Eighth District Court of Appeals that allowed him to be released from probation. He was originally sentenced to five years on probation following his release, but the common pleas judge sentenced him to \u201cthe maximum allowable\u201d time on probation. The panel of judges ruled the probation portion of his sentence was incorrect because it was too vague. Middleton pleaded guilty to strangling Karen Spencer, 42, on Sept. 22, 2000, then stuffing her in the trunk of Spencer\u2019s 1997 Mercedes Benz. Spencer parked the car near Shaker Square and left. Plain Dealer archives say Middleton killed Spencer after she kicked him out of their home after a nearly 10-year relationship. Spencer, archives say, was the top administrator for the county\u2019s health board where she made an $81,000 salary. She was the mother of two of Middleton\u2019s children and was an impeccable dresser, which helped detectives at the time see through evidence Middleton tried to plant to make it look like a car jacking. Archives say she was wearing a blue suit at the time and Middleton put green shoes in the trunk with her. Middleton was also convicted of tampering with evidence in the case. The couple\u2019s children were 4 and 1 years old at the time, archives say. \"I strangled her,\" Middleton said with his voice cracking during his sentencing hearing, according to a 2001 Plain Dealer story. \"I put her in the trunk,\" he said after a long pause, tears flowing. \"And I took her to Shaker Square. I'm sorry.\" Middleton has a history of violence against women. Archives say he was convicted of domestic violence in 1999 when Middleton and Spencer lived in University Heights. Middleton grabbed her, started choking her and slammed her head through a wall. Middleton was also arrested in 1997, according to archives, for choking Spencer. He was convicted in 1992 of domestic violence against another woman, who he had a child with, archives say.

Just before 2 a.m. Friday BPD officers responded to a shooting in the area of Lake and Brown Streets. \"They located an adult male down in the roadway suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest,\" BPD Sgt. Nathan McCauley said. The victim told officers he and two friends were walking when a man in his 20s approached them and shot the victim with a handgun. The victim, a man, was taken to Kern Medical where he is listed in critical condition. Later in the day, officers say they went to the crime scene, based on information from the ShotSpotter system. The ShotSpotter location system was able to determine the shooting actually happened in the 1800 block of Lake Street, where BPD was able to recover physical evidence.

Senior United States District Judge Margaret B. Seymour accepted the plea and will impose a sentence after she has reviewed the presentence report, which will be prepared by the U.S. Probation Office. Evidence presented at the change of plea hearing established that on January 22, 2014, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), executed a federal search warrant at CONTARTESI\u2019s Rock Hill residence after learning that CONTARTESI, a prohibited felon, was in possession of firearms and ammunition.

Mr. Nettles stated that CONTARTESI faces a statutory maximum sentence of ten (10) years, a fine of $250,000 and a term of supervised release of up to three (3) years following the term of imprisonment. The case was investigated by ATF and was prosecuted as part of the joint federal, state and local Project CeaseFire initiative, which aggressively prosecutes firearm cases.

NBC 7's Megan Tevrizian reports. (Published Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2014) A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a man after he was struck in the face with a rock, officials said Tuesday. The shooting occurred around 6:40 a.m. along Otay Mountain Truck Trail near Alta Road, southeast of Otay Reservoir and east of State Route 125. San Diego County sheriff's homicide detective Lt. Glenn Giannantonio said two agents were pursuing who they believed to be undocumented immigrants in the area approximately four miles east of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. The two agents were separated when one was struck in the face by a rock, officials said. On Wednesday, investigators released further information on the incident. They say the Border Patrol agent followed the suspect through a ravine and up a hillside when the suspect began throwing fist-sized rocks. The agent ordered the man to stop in English and in Spanish and used his hands to deflect some of the rocks, officials said. The suspect continued to throw rocks at the agent, according to investigators.

Between Good Friday and the end of Easter Sunday, the city had six homicides and 15 shooting victims at 11 crime scenes, according to police. Deputy Police Chief David LeValley said Monday that one arrest has been made so far, involving the fatal shooting of a man whose body was found Sunday morning at 2:30 a.m. The body was discovered in the 6000 block of Holcomb. The victim, who wasn\u2019t identified, is believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s, said police. LeValley didn\u2019t identify the suspect, saying only that he was being questioned at police headquarters Monday afternoon. The deputy chief said he was confident more arrests would follow in the other shootings. \u201cWe have dozens of detectives working around the clock,\u201d he said. He said the police\u2019s closure rate was higher than usual this year, 74 percent. The national average is 64 percent and Detroit\u2019s rate in other years was as low as 60, he said. LeValley attributed the higher rate to a drop in crime in March, which gave detectives a chance to solve other cases. He said he didn\u2019t know why so many shootings occurred over the weekend. He said none of them appeared to be related. The violence started Friday just before 2 p.m., on the 9300 block of Steel, when a 23-year-old man walking in the Sreett says he heard shots and felt pain and realized he had been shot. He remained in critical condition Monday.

Rosalia Vazquez, who lives several doors down from where the shooting occurred inside the Park Sierra Apartments, said she wasn\u2019t home at the time. But she knew when she arrived home that something had happened because the apartment door was barricaded. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet usually.

I can\u2019t imagine this happening.\u201d The death marked the 36th on-duty officer killed by accidental gunfire in California since 1895. The last time a police officer in Alameda County was killed by another officer was in January 2001, when two Oakland police officers shot and killed an undercover detective. Officer William Wilkins was pursing an auto thief near 89th Avenue when Officers Andrew Koponen and Timothy Scarrott arrived as Wilkins drew his weapon on the suspect. Both officers fired several times, killing Wilkins, after they said he ignored orders to drop the weapon. The shooting was the latest challenge for the BART system and its police force. Jan. 1 marked five years since BART police officer Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, who was being detained on a platform at the Fruitvale station. More recently, the system was shut down by failed contract negotiations that led to strikes that stranded hundreds of thousands of Bay Area commuters in July and October.

The victim did not address the Court as DiAngilo Antuan Bell, 23, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault. But his father did. The father was outraged at Bell\u2019s betrayal of his son\u2019s friendship: \u201cThis man has been to my house,\u201d he said of Bell. \u201cHe played with my son.\u201d Bell had shared dinner with his family, the father said, yet Bell still tried to kill his son. So, whatever sentence Superior Court Judge Maureen Gottfried gave Bell, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be strong enough,\u201d the father said. Gottfried sentenced Bell to 10 years in prison with five to serve, and the rest on probation. She also ordered him never again to have any contact with the victim\u2019s family. Bell\u2019s Atlanta defense attorney Lamar Rhodes sought a more lenient penalty, asking that Bell serve only three years. Again the father argued Bell deserved more time \u2013 of his son saying, \u201cHe\u2019s going to suffer the rest of his life.\u201d Neither Bell nor the victim would disclose any motive for the assault. Bell, who disputed facts of the case as recited by Senior Assistant District Attorney Don Kelly, told Gottfried he would suffer by being separated from his son while in prison. \u201cNo hard feelings to the victim,\u201d he added. \u201cI still love him like a brother.\u201d That was not evident from the way Bell assaulted his longtime friend earlier this year at 1052 Winston Road in Columbus, an area now infamous for shootings and homicides, authorities said.\u2018Kelly said the victim\u2019s mother dropped him off at some apartments there, where he was to meet a friend. He was outside when a car pulled up and Bell got out, covering the lower half of his face with a bandana. Bell pulled out a handgun and opened fire, striking the other man in the neck, wrist and hip, the latter wound causing permanent injury. As Bell fled, the victim went to a nearby apartment for help. The resident there let him in, called the police and put pressure on the his wounds to reduce the bleeding. As an ambulance rushed the victim to the hospital, the apartment resident reported to officers the man had told him \u201cLo,\u201d the name by which he knew Bell, had shot him. The victim later picked Bell\u2019s picture from a photographic lineup. Police got warrants to arrest Bell, who surrendered to officers on Jan. 17. In delivering Bell\u2019s sentence, Gottfried told Bell he was lucky the victim suffered only \u201clifelong scars,\u201d as he could have died from his wounds. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re not facing a murder charge,\u201d the judge said.

In Lowell District Court on Tuesday, Joseph Montanez, 20, and Joseph Szukewski, 23, pleaded not guilty to armed robbery. Szukewski was also charged with disorderly conduct. Montanez was additionally charged with carrying a loaded shotgun, using a firearm in a felony, possessing a firearm with a defaced serial number in a felony, possession of ammunition without a firearms-identification card, and receiving stolen property. Prosecutor Rachel Perlman alleges Montanez and Szukewski were meeting the alleged victim at around 6 p.m. Monday in Lowell to buy a small amount of marijuana. As the alleged victim sat in his car, Szukewski allegedly pressed the barrel of his handgun against the victim's neck while Montanez pointed a sawed-off shotgun at the victim, and stole $140 and two iPhones. The victim identified Montanez as the man holding the shotgun and provided police with a description of the other robber, police allege. As Lowell police were tracking one of the iPhones, police said they spotted the two men walking along Butterfield Street. The two fled, allegedly dropping the weapons and a shotgun shell, prosecutors allege. They were eventually arrested by police.

Why did this happen?\" Pickett said. \"He was a sweet, all-around kind guy.

More: Three shot, including officer, in Montgomery; one person dead The shooting deaths of two men on Maury Street in early January were classified as death investigations. Montgomery police last week arrested 18-year-old Kevonta Brown on felony murder charges. In separating deaths into homicide and death investigations, Montgomery cites FBI Uniform Crime Reporting guidelines, which define criminal homicide as \"Murder and non-negligent manslaughter: the willful (non-negligent) killing of one human being by another. Deaths caused by negligence, attempts to kill, assaults to kill, suicides and accidental deaths are excluded.\" Justifiable homicides are classified separately. Death investigations are not typically included on Montgomery's crime mapping tool. The city is currently outpacing its homicide numbers from 2017. Montgomery police reported four homicides in January and February of last year. Of the four homicides, two were shooting deaths. Montgomery police reported 44 homicides overall in 2017.

Vandine, 37, was arrested March 19 and charged with receiving stolen property \u2013 a gun stolen in November 2016. The Maine Department of Public Safety stated in a news release that Vandine is a suspect in numerous burglaries at storage units. Assistant District Attorney Christopher Fernald said Vandine\u2019s criminal history dates back to 1997 and includes numerous burglaries, thefts and possession of firearms by a felon, as well as an assault on an officer. Maine State Police Sgt. Patrick Hood was notified in December by Maine Game Warden Mark Merrifield that a convicted felon might by in possession of a gun, according to an affidavit filed in Knox County Unified Court. A landowner off Highland Road had complained of a tent being set up on his property without his permission. The warden checked on the complaint and found ammunition. Hood and Merrifield interviewed the man and he admitted he had a gun and said he had bought it from Vandine, according to the affidavit. The gun had been stolen from a home in Newcastle on Oct. 25, 2016. Police began checking on Vandine and checking the vehicles he owned to see if they matched surveillance photographs from several break-ins at storage units. In one break-in at a Woolwich storage unit, about $100,000 in antiques had been stolen, according to the affidavit. A surveillance photograph showed a vehicle similar to what Vandine owned at the time. A surveillance tape from a nearby convenience store also showed the vehicle and a man going into the store who resembled Vandine\u2019s photo on his Facebook page, according to the police report. Police looked into other break-ins, including a May 29, 2017 burglary at a coin shop on West Street in Rockport. Five days earlier a man fitting Vandine\u2019s description had been in the coin shop and afterward, about $1,000 in coins disappeared, according to the affidavit. Police found that Vandine had given some rare coins the previous summer to the man he had sold the stolen gun to, according to the affidavit.

A search of Minus\u2019s home turned up drugs and a loaded semi-automatic handgun. Minus pled guilty to Drug Dealing Heroin and Possession of a Firearm by a Person Prohibited and the probation violation. A Superior Court judge sentenced Minus to 5 years in prison, followed by 18 months of probation. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney prosecuted the case. A 38-year old habitual offender faces at least 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to Attempted Rape Second Degree and Assault Second Degree. In April 2017, Joseph Snow of New Castle approached a woman sitting on the ground at a bus stop in the 800 of North King Street in Wilmington, and attempted to force her to perform a sex act on him. When the woman refused, he began to choke her and punch her in the face. The assault continued until the crew of an off-duty ambulance that was driving by saw and stopped the attack. Snow, considered a habitual offender due to past convictions on weapons, rioting, and reckless endangering charges, faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced by a Superior Court judge in July. Deputy Attorney General Jenna Milecki prosecuted the case, Lisa Rapko was the social worker, and Jayna Quillen was the paralegal. A plea to 6 felony charges could lead to an extended prison term for a 35-year-old Wilmington man. Deputy Attorney General Kelly Sheridan secured the plea from Brandon Brown. In early 2017, Brown stole thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of cigarettes and other items from several convenience stores throughout New Castle County. Brown pled guilty to Wearing a Disguise, Aggravated Menacing, Robbery Second Degree, 2 counts of Burglary Third Degree, and Conspiracy Second Degree. Due to previous felony convictions on drug and weapons charges, a Superior Court judge will sentence Brown in June as a habitual offender to at least 10 years in prison.

It just so happened that the victim was home alone inside her house asleep when someone sprayed the house with bullets. Some of the bullets went next door, striking the car in the driveway and the neighbor's front door. \"These two are under my daughter's bed,\" Antionne Nailor said as tears fell from his face just at the thought of his daughter possibly being in the path of gunfire. Antionne Nailor broke down crying while pointing out where the two bullets struck inside his daughter's bedroom and struck the girl's mother as she slept in their daughter's bed. \"She got hit in her back and in the back of her neck two shots,\" Nailor said. Their Maura Lane home is full of bullet holes after someone opened fire on the house just before 2 a.m. Since Antionne's daughter stayed at her grandmother's, the girl's mother stayed in her room for the night as Antionne picked up an extra shift at work. \"She got hit in my daughter's bed where she would have been that night,\" said Nailor. \"We all would have been here tonight. I only worked for somebody else and I didn't want to do it and if I would have been here, I would have been dead.\" There are bullet holes in the windows, the front door, and all over the front siding of Antionne's home. \"Now I have bullet holes - more than I can count,\" he said. \"More than I want to count.\" Some of the gunfire hit next door, striking the windshield of a 2010 Dodge Charger. The car's windshield has two bullet holes on the passenger side. The glass on the neighbor's front screen door also got hit.

As many as five townhouse apartments were hit by gunfire and bullets crashed through windows in the 1:45 p.m. incident, but no people were injured, said Sgt.

Arrested were Rakeem Nelson, 21, of 768 Belmont Ave., and Willie Duke, 20, of 1116 Street James Avenue Each was charged with carrying a loaded firearm, discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling, and six counts each of assault by means of a dangerous weapon and malicious damage of more than $250. Nelson and Duke were apprehended as officers Jonathan Turner and John Carolan, responding to the initial report of gunfire, spotted the pair running across State Street near Terrance Street. The officers gave chase because Nelson and Duke matched the description of the suspects being given out by witnesses at the scene, Delaney said. They were apprehended by Turner and Carolan after a brief chase. They were found in possession of a .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun. Witnesses at the scene would later identify them as the people involved in the shooting, Delaney said. Springfield police detectives Eugene Dean and Steven Tatro use orange evidence markers to identify the location of spent shell casings and other evidence found after a Wednesday afternoon shooting near Magazine Park in the city's McKnight section. Delaney said the preliminary investigation showed that one of the pair had recently been in a fight with someone else at that scene earlier in the day, but had been beaten up so badly that the pair decided to get a gun and come back. Nelson is known to police. Police records show that since Jan. 1, he has been arrested three times. On Jan.1, he was arrested on Andrew Street and charged with receiving a stolen motor vehicle and operating without a license. On Jan. 15, he was arrested on Island Pond Road on a charge of assault with a handgun. At their arraignment Thursday in Springfield District Court, Nelson and Duke each denied the charges.

Neighbors reported that the man, who was between 30 and 40 years old, had startled on woman and entered a residence, threatening the two occupants. According to Police Chief Miguel Colon, the man then returned to his own home where he locked his 85-year-old father out of the house and ignored the demands of officers to come out. The man was believed to be mentally ill and his father reported that there were several firearms within the home. Police attempted to contact an Imperial County Behavioral Health Service crisis team in to assist with negotiations. However, they were unable to receive assistance. At one point the man stepped out of the house, but immediately returned inside when he discovered that officers were still waiting outside. A K9 officer with the California Highway Patrol was released in order to subdue the man and was able to restrain him with only a minor bite. The suspect was taken into custody and transported to El Centro Regional Medical Center. At this time, officers confiscated the firearms in the home. According to Colon, the new expansion of California gun laws required seizure of the weapons because of the proximity to a mentally ill individual. It is unlikely that the weapons will be released back to the owner. While charges were written up of the suspect, Colon was doubtful that they would be filed based on the man\u2019s mental status.

A State Police press release said shots were fired by at least one Farmington police officer. FARMINGTON \u2014 Law enforcement officials have identified the man shot and killed by police early Tuesday at a Farmington motel. Andrew Rossi, 25, was the suspect shot and killed by a SWAT officer for the Farmington Police Department in a room at the Motel 6 after Rossi allegedly charged officers with a knife. Rossi was wanted in connection to a shooting in Colorado. A New Mexico State Police press release issued late Tuesday stated Rossi was wanted out of Ignacio, Colorado, on a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. A search warrant obtained by The Daily Times states Rossi had been a suspect in a shooting that resulted in multiple gunshot wounds for the victim, who was a \"stable victim (Monday) in Ignacio Colorado.\" Messages left for the Ignacio Police Department were not returned. The search warrant also details how law enforcement officials located Rossi's vehicle at the motel Monday night. A deputy for the San Juan County Sheriff's Office was dispatched to a residence on County Road 5580 in Crouch Mesa on reports of a disturbance. A Rossi family member told the deputy the suspect had shown up at the residence with his mother and was looking for a Place to stay. The family member forced Rossi and his mother to leave the residence. The family member added that Rossi had a handgun on him. As part of the investigation, the deputy learned Rossi had left the property and was headed toward Farmington in search of a motel. During a search of Farmington motels, deputies located Rossi's red Cadillac vehicle with a Colorado license plate at the Motel 6 at 1600 Bloomfield Boulevard around 8:45 p.m. Monday. As the search warrant was being drafted, Rossi's mother exited the motel room and was taken into custody for her safety. The warrant also stated Rossi had a 2014 conviction and should not be in possession of a firearm. After the SWAT team for the Farmington police arrived on the scene around 10:58 p.m., officers started calling for Rossi to come out, according to a Farmington Police Department press release. A hostage negotiator attempted to make contact with Rossi, but contact was never established. Around 1 a.m., SWAT officers slowly made entry into the motel room and heard movement in the ceiling. As SWAT officers removed ceiling tiles, Rossi fell from the ceiling to the ground. Rossi stood up and charged the officers with a knife, police said. The State Police press release said shots fired by at least one Farmington police officer struck Rossi. The name of the SWAT officer or officers who shot the suspect was not released. The number of shots fired by the officer or officers was not released. His gunshot wounds were fatal, as Rossi died after being transported to the San Juan Regional Medical Center. The case remains under investigation. Tuesday's shooting was the second fatal officer-involved shooting involving an officer for the Farmington Police Department in recent months. On Dec. 20, Officer Brandt Warman fired five shots at Aztec resident Frankie Anchondo, 35, in an area north of U.S. Highway 64 in southeast Farmington during an attempted traffic stop.

Deputies say Tinny then left the bedroom and his wife and her child locked the door. Tinny forced his way into the room, breaking the door frame, and holding a Taurus 1911 .45-caliber pistol. He raised the pistol to his wife, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. By this time someone within the home had called 911, the sheriff\u2019s office said, and the recording captured voices, screams, and a gunshot. Tinny\u2019s wife reached for his right arm, and pushed it away to prevent him from firing the pistol, according to the sheriff\u2019s office, but the weapon fired during the struggle. The bullet missed her head by inches, deputies said, and struck the wall over the bed. Tinny\u2019s wife was screaming for help, and her adult son came in from a nearby bedroom, and wrestled the gun from Tinny\u2019s hands, deputies said. The firearm jammed, and did not cycle a second round, preventing it from firing a second time, according to the investigation. Hernando County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Tinny, who refused to provide a statement. Tinny was hired May 31, 1985 and retired from the Pasco Sheriff\u2019s Office June 25, 2010, said Doug Tobin, spokesman for the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He retired as a Bailiff Law Enforcement, according to Tobin. The investigation remains active, according to the Hernando County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the 911 recording is not being made public at this time. The sheriff\u2019s office referenced state law for why they are not releasing the address where the incident occurred, due to Tinny being a retired Pasco County deputy, they said.

Urbana police Sgt. Dan Morgan said Officer Matt Quinley was patrolling around Urbana High School about 2 a.m. when he spotted a car in the parking lot that appeared to have been burgled. Driving around the area to see if he could find someone related to that, Quinley spotted a man on a bicycle whom he identified as Rommell Smith. Smith, 23, now homeless, had been wanted by police in connection with cannabis and a gun that police found in the Vawter Street apartment where Smith was living in February. Morgan said about 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 2, police were sent to an apartment complex in the 2000 block of Vawter Street where several shots had been fired. No one was present but within minutes, police located Smith at a nearby convenience store with cuts and abrasions, some of which happened when he fell running away. Smith reported he was in the Vawter apartment when several men forced their way in. Morgan said Smith fought, pulling a gun to defend himself. In the struggle over the gun with one of the intruders, several shots were fired. The intruders fled, as did Smith, Morgan said. About 15 minutes after the shots-fired call, a man with multiple gunshot wounds was dropped off at the emergency room entrance at Carle Foundation Hospital, Morgan said. \"In spite of being shot five times, he got up and walked in,\" said Morgan, declining to identify that man, who survived the shots. Morgan said Smith was being treated there at the same time for cuts to his hands. Meantime, back at the Vawter apartment, police searched and found more than 500 grams of cannabis, packaging materials and .380-caliber ammunition. Smith was not arrested that day. Morgan said about two weeks later, on Feb. 14, police were sent to another shots-fired call at an apartment in the 1700 block of East Florida Avenue. Morgan said police learned that Smith had been staying at the apartment where a shot went through the floor into the apartment below. The caliber of the gun fired that afternoon matched the caliber of one of the two weapons that had been fired in the Vawter home invasion earlier that month. Smith was not located that day. When Quinley stopped Smith early Thursday, he had a .32-caliber handgun in his pocket, for which he had no concealed carry license or firearm owner's identification card, Morgan said. On Thursday, the state's attorney office charged Smith with unlawful possession with intent to deliver cannabis stemming from the cannabis found in his apartment Feb. 2.

Police vehicles were stationed at various points throughout the neighborhood shortly afterward, with most of them posted in the 2400 block of Lavender Street, which sits between Jonquil Street and Iris Street. Vehicles marked NOPD, Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) Police and Orleans Levee District Police were on scene. A man at the scene said he heard the shooting shortly after he noticed a man with a white mask -- with the mask turned to the back like a backwards ball cap--walk past a store at Lavender and Clematis streets, headed toward Jonquil Street. \"That's what caught my attention -- why you wearing a solid white mask to the back of your head for?\" The man, who declined to give his name out of concern for his personal safety, said he then heard about nine gunshots. Next, the witness said he saw the man in the mask, this time turned to the front to cover his face, run past the store in the opposite direction, headed toward Clover Street. A police officer began chasing the masked man, the witness said. The witness said he then saw the same man a third time on Lavender Street, walking toward Clematis Street, this time with no mask.

The man, who also declined to give his name out of concern for his personal safety, said he saw the shooter run on Clematis toward Lavender Street and then stop to reload his gun before returning to the area of the white home and firing more shots. He said he then saw the gunman head toward Lavender Street again. As the sun began to set Thursday, police remained throughout the neighborhood, including at Clematis and Clover streets, which had a HANO car blocking the intersection. There, several people mentioned that a shooting had just occurred two days prior in the 3700 block of Clematis Street. In that shooting, a 21-year-old man told police that he was leaving a store around 5:41 p.m. Tuesday when he saw a man behind him.

Five of 36 guns discovered by TSA agents at airports around the country last week.

And continuing the pattern, several did so while happily and unconcernedly carrying their hand-held instant death machines among you, while out shopping, dining or otherwise enjoying the amenities. Were you in Chipotle in Sandy, Utah, last week? Walmart in Hattiesburg, Mississippi? Sam's Club in Waterloo, Iowa? Perhaps the YMCA in Austin, Texas? Maybe you weren't, but people who were certain they knew how to properly handle their firearms were. And guess where they found out that they weren't really up to the task? Right in the middle of the crowds, of course! Miraculously, only one car window and one ass (anatomically speaking) were damaged. You can thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that none of the children at their swimming lessons at the Y were shot when mom blew a hole in her purse rummaging around down in Austin. A few \"coincidences\" worthy of note this time around: two people accidentally discharged their weapons while giving demonstrations of how safe they were, one lodging a bullet in his living room floor, and one lodging a bullet in a Place that stopped him from living and left him on the floor. Last week also saw two young men accidentally shoot their mothers, one in Oconee Co., South Carolina, and one in Dayton, Nevada. And although this one doesn't exactly fit, an Orlando, Florida, man accidentally fired his gun twice while he was cleaning it (of course). His first shot flew through his garage door and into the street, where it blasted a hole in a passing car, and microseconds thereafter, the 12-year-old girl inside it. So flustered by this accident was he that he fired a second shot through his own thigh. There were three \"home invasion\" shootings, in which civic-minded patriots opt to share their used ammunition with neighbors. The most worthy of note being the Marion, Ohio, accident in which a good guy with a shotgun decided to participate in the prayer meeting in the downstairs apartment. His testimony was witnessed by two of the ladies of the assembly. Outside of those noteworthy items, we saw the usual assortment of accidents. One hunting accident, one accident while \"fixing\" a gun, one target shooting mishap, one stray bullet shooting, and one cop's gun that went off when it was grabbed by a suspect.

Her husband told her to get down. After a few moments, they looked out the window to an empty street. No one was running. Nothing looked out of sorts. They figured the gunshots weren't near. On Thursday morning, police discovered the truth: Two people had been shot dead inside a green car parked outside a vacant home. A man sitting in the front passenger seat was still holding a cigarette, a witness said. The woman behind him was also slumped over. \"There was nobody screaming, nothing,\" said the woman who heard the shooting, who declined to provide her name out of fear because no one has been arrested. Police say they are working to determine exactly when the shooting took place, but several people in the Mount Clare neighborhood near Traci Atkins Park said they heard gunfire in the night. The number of killings in Baltimore has jumped at the start of the year, which comes after two straight years of increases. The man and woman found in the car on Thursday were the city's 23rd and 24th homicide victims. A 25th homicide \u2014 the third of the day \u2014 was reported just before 7 p.m., when officers found a 56-year-old man in the 4200 block of Walrad Street suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Doctors could not save him. The number of homicides in Baltimore this month has eclipsed the count last year at this time by 11. It's the most homicides in a January since 2007, when 28 people were killed. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said in a radio interview Thursday that he did not like the way the news media have portrayed the violence. \"I'm a little concerned at times that we get people incensed, outraged, nervous, when you need to get a full picture of it,\" Batts told Anthony McCarthy on WEAA. He noted that last year's homicide count was still the third-lowest in the past 20 years. He called homicide the \"most egregious\" crime but said that \"some people are putting themselves in a position to have these incidents taking place.\" He gave the example of a marijuana buyer who is robbed and shot. Thursday's double homicide marked the 10th shooting and seventh killing linked to a car. Victims include Ricky Mellerson, 28, who was found shot to death in an overturned car near the Washington Monument on Jan. 11, and Spencer Falcon, 28, who died in a carjacking Jan. 10. Victims have been shot while driving and while getting out of cars. One was pulled out of a car and shot. During a virtual \"town hall\" session on Twitter, Batts acknowledged Thursday that the number of car-related shootings suggested a trend. \"We are starting to see a pattern of weed deliveries where drug victims are meeting dealers in cars,\" he said on Twitter. Daniel W. Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he hasn't seen research on shootings directed at people in vehicles. But he said there are several reasons criminals might target intended victims in cars. People spend a lot of time in cars, he said. They often can be identified and targeted by their vehicles. If ambushed, they have a limited ability to escape. Baltimore police spokesman Detective Jeremy Silbert said officers were dispatched to the 1500 block of Cole Street at 9:40 a.m. Thursday on a report of a shooting. But he said homicide detectives will be speaking to neighbors and reviewing 911 calls in the area the night before. Both victims were dead when police arrived, he said.

The bodies were found yards from tall concrete pillars and railroad tracks used in scenes of HBO's \"The Wire\" television series. Police on Thursday also identified two recent victims.

But a local gun rights group says the man did nothing wrong and the arrest was unlawful. Michael Keoughan, a 27-year-old U.S. Army veteran, was walking through the small town around lunch time with a rifle strapped across his back when the disturbance started, local media reports. \u201cI was driving down Main Street to go get lunch and I saw a man with a rifle on his back,\u201d explained Angela Arthur, who snapped a picture of the man and called 911 along with several other people. \u201cI was gonna stop at Allsups but then I thought he maybe was gonna go in there so I changed my mind and just went somewhere else because it\u2019s scary.\u201d A short time later, a nearby middle school was placed on lockdown as Keoughan was surrounded by the police, eventually being arrested for disorderly conduct and displaying a weapon in a manner calculated to cause alarm. Keoughan, along with others, believe his arrest was unlawful, as in the state of Texas it is legal to openly carry long arms provided they are displayed in a non-threatening and non-alarming manner. Even Arthur, who called 911, admitted that Keoughan wasn\u2019t acting in a threatening manner. \u201cHe was just calmly walking,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think anything of it unless he didn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d And according to Keoughan he \u201chad great interactions throughout the entire day until the police showed up.\u201d Stephanie McDonald, a member of Midland chapter of the gun rights group \u201cCome and Take It\u201d also believes Keoughan\u2019s arrest was unlawful. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a valid charge when he was just walking down the Sreett with his rifle across his back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t across his front, he wasn\u2019t carrying it in his hands, he wasn\u2019t brandishing it. It was simply strung across his back.\u201d Keoughan was actually out that afternoon searching for a suitable route for a weekend rally hosted by the group, whose primary goal is to educate and inform the public about the legalities of open carry. Part of the reason Keoughan\u2019s arrest came as such a shock to the group was that they believed they had \u201cassurances\u201d from Police Chief Bud Jones that something like this would not occur again. However, Jones believed that their \u201cassurances\u201d were more of a miscommunication. \u201cIf an individual on his own wants to do that, he, out of the common courtesy, should contact us. That\u2019s what I told them,\u201d Jones said, adding, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who he was, had no clue, but we started getting a mass number of phone calls, by displaying the weapon, he caused undue alarm.\u201d Jones, who said the gun rights group has his full support, stated that his main concern is for the protection of the people in the community. \u201cThis is the issue that they don\u2019t want to address that we have to address,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen we get a call about a person with a gun, do we ignore it? Walking down the street? They\u2019re alluding to the fact that we don\u2019t have any right to make contact to them because they\u2019re not doing anything wrong. I beg to differ with them.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell anybody, they say they don\u2019t have to, and yeah they probably don\u2019t, but when they disrupt the community like they did, something has to happen,\u201d Jones later told a local CBS affiliate. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a hostile environment, but again you have an armed individual and I\u2019m not going to go into detail on what we consider a hostile environment,\u201d Jones added. However, Keoughan doesn\u2019t argue with law enforcement\u2019s right to investigate the situation, what he doesn\u2019t agree with is the fact that he was still arrested and charged with what he feels are false accusations. \u201cJust because someone calls in and says they\u2019re alarmed doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an actual threat in the carrying,\u201d McDonald agreed. \u201cIt can be alarming to some, I understand that but that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re here. To educate the public and get the word out that we\u2019re not the enemy. We\u2019re fighting for your rights.\u201d Keoughan was the second member of \u201cCome and Take It\u201d to be arrested in Andrews after openly carrying a long arm, in addition to several others recently arrested across Texas for the same offense.

Zapar, 35, and Peyton, a 10-year-old Rottweiler, had been inseparable over the last decade. The dog died from an illness in December. \u201cRobbie and Peyton were extremely close,\u201d said Robert Haydak, his uncle. \u201cRobbie is a recent homeowner. He put a ramp on the front of the house for the dog. He had the yard fenced in. Basically, his life revolved around Peyton.\u201d On Friday, city police identified Zapar as the shooting victim at the Animal Clinic of Millville on West Main Street. Detective Lt. Ross Hoffman said Zapar shot himself, while sitting in his pickup truck in the parking lot. He had just delivered a four-page note to the office, asking to have it given to his veterinarian. Hoffman said the letter detailed what happened with the dog and his grief. Haydak confirmed Peyton had been ill and scheduled for surgery on his spleen, but the dog then staged an apparent comeback. His nephew at that point chose not to pursue the surgery and the dog relapsed, he said. Peyton died in his owner\u2019s arms outside the clinic, where Zapar had rushed the ailing animal, the uncle said. Zapar had suffered a fractured skull in a motorcycle accident in late 2009 while living in Florida. The injury left him near death and with a long, difficult rehabilitation. Haydak said his nephew, then 25, was cut off by a hit-and-run driver and was kept in a coma for several weeks. \u201cAnd, basically, it forced him to learn over how to walk and how to talk,\u201d Haydak said. Last year, Zapar went to work at the Landis Sewerage Authority.

Rick Beghtol were retrieving police property from Abundez-Ramirez\u2019s apartment. Spokane Superior Court arresting documents indicate Abundez-Ramirez broke into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s Barrington Apartment Complex apartment about 3 a.m. that Sunday morning, startling her roommate by standing over her bed. Abundez-Ramirez yelled at the roommate for approximately 15 minutes demanding to know where his ex-girlfriend was, offering at one point to pay the roommate \u2013 who told officers he smelled of intoxicants \u2013 to not tell anyone before leaving. The roommate received several phone calls from Abundez-Ramirez throughout the course of the day, including from his roommate\u2019s phone after she blocked his personal cell number. Cheney Police Chief John Hensley said they learned of Abundez-Ramirez\u2019s activities and after he and Cmdr.

A knife and 9mm handgun were confiscated upon a body search, and he was twice read his Miranda rights, refusing to answer questions without his attorney. Beghtol told Abundez-Ramirez it was necessary to get other department equipment issued him, and they subsequently retrieved his badge and handgun after he gave them permission to search his vehicle. The rest of the equipment was at his College Hill apartment, and after saying his roommate was home, gave Beghtol permission to enter the apartment and retrieve the uniform, ballistic vest and utility belt. Oakes and Beghtol drove Abundez-Ramirez to the complex, parking out of sight of the apartment in what Oakes termed a \u201ctactical approach.\u201d Beghtol went to the apartment and knocked on the door while Oakes stood outside the vehicle, keeping the back door open in order to maintain line of sight contact with Beghtol and communicate with Abundez-Ramirez. Beghtol received no answers to his knocks. Oakes said while this was happening he looked in at Abundez-Ramirez and noticed he had slid to the passenger side of the back seat and was sitting with this handcuffed hands in front of him, \u201cquite the feat\u201d Oakes said considering the handcuffs were hinged to limit movement and Abundez-Ramirez is not a small man. Oakes said he attempted to take the suspect out of the vehicle to reposition the handcuffs when Abundez-Ramirez attacked him. \u201cHe lunged face to face,\u201d Oakes said. \u201cHe started going for my gun.\u201d Both men hit the pavement as Oakes struck Abundez-Ramirez repeatedly in the face while pulling on the handgun.

He later told police he feared for his life and fired in self-defense, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday against the alleged robber. The suspect ran away. Soon after, a man showed up at Regions Hospital with a gunshot wound to the ankle. He received treatment and police investigation revealed he had been shot during the robbery in the 1100 block of Rice Street, Ernster said.

After meeting at the SuperAmerica at Fairview and Street Clair avenues, the would-be buyer said he wanted to go to a different location, according to Ernster. They drove to the area of Fairmount Avenue and Howell Street, where the 24-year-old got in the front seat of the man\u2019s vehicle. The man took money out of his pocket and the 24-year-old handed over the phone, but they wound up in a tug-of-war over the cash and the phone, Ernster said. The suspect used his other hand to pull a pistol out of his pocket, at which point the 24-year-old jumped out of the vehicle and started running away. The robber shot at him and drove away. Police did not find the suspect, who was described as being a black man in his 20s, 5-feet-11-inches tall, 200 pounds, with shoulder-length dreadlocks and a beard. He was wearing jeans and a beige-hooded sweatshirt, and driving a Mercury Marquis that was teal or light green.

The buyer pulled his own .357 revolver and shot the man, who ran away. He drove home and called police, according to the criminal complaint against Maddox. When police talked to Maddox, he reported \u201che was just walking down the street, heard gunshots, ran and was hit,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cHe denied being involved in any Facebook communications, in making a deal for an iPhone, or in a robbery.\u201d The man who was robbed went to police headquarters and, after viewing a photo lineup, identified Maddox as the robber, the complaint said.

In many neighborhoods in most major US cities, like Cleveland, the sound of gunfire is part of daily life. \"The reality is that families on these streets are under siege,\" said Khalid Samad, a long-time civil rights activist and founder of Cleveland's Peace in the Hood. \"Everybody's under siege.\" Activists like Samad say that national conversations about gun control that come in the wake of mass shootings, at times, exclude discussions about inner-city violence. The protesters inspired by the Valentine's Day massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida steered the conversation directly toward the sort of everyday gun violence that affects people living in inner cities-- and not just the rash of school shootings that often dominate headlines. Samad, who said that community and political organizing is one of the few options left to those affected by gun violence, led a small group of Cleveland residents to Saturday's March for Our Lives rally in Washington, where they spoke with some survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting, Samad said. \"They said it was intentional for them to use their platform...that this massacre has afforded them. They knew that if those had been African-American children (who were shot), it wouldn't have gotten as much publicity,\" Samad said. Samad's group also listened to eleven-year-old Naomi Wadler, an Alexandria, Virginia girl who spoke at Saturday morning's event and called attention to the gun-related deaths that overwhelmingly affect communities of color in urban areas. \"I am here today to acknowledge and represent the African American girls whose stories do not make the front page of every national newspaper,\" Wadler said. \"I represent the African American women who are the victims of gun violence who are simply statistics instead of vibrant beautiful girls full of potential. I'm here to say never again for those girls too.\" At least 111 of the roughly 130 homicides that happened in Cleveland last year were the result of gun violence, according to an unofficial tally of cleveland.com records. And in 2017, the city recorded 2,715 instances of felonious assault, which includes shootings and other serious assaults. Between the beginning of this year and March 21, there were 137 shootings in Cleveland in which victims reported being shot or being fired at, Cleveland police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said. Shooting and gun homicide statistics for other recent years were not immediately available for review. One such instance of gun violence happened at about 2 a.m. Sunday when a 29-year-old man told police he was shot while trying to break up a fight outside the B&G Tavern on Lorain Avenue in the Ohio City neighborhood, according to police reports. The man suffered a gunshot wound to the knee after a car pulled up alongside a group of people outside the bar and a passenger fired several rounds at the crowd, reports say. An hour later, police found a car riddled with bullet holes at East 55th Street and Euclid Avenue -- three bullets tore through the trunk and three more went through the side of the car. Officers found no one inside. And about four hours before that, a bullet was fired into a home on Spring Road in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood, other reports say. Three people were in the house at the time of shooting, and one man said that a bullet flew through the bedroom wall and nearly struck him, the reports say. Such instances rarely garner widespread attention because they have come to be commonplace in a city that was ranked in 2016 as having one of the highest rates of murder rates per capita by The Trace, an organization that monitors gun violence in America. Cleveland ranked fifth on that list behind Street Louis, Baltimore, Detroit and New Orleans. Chicago ranked eighth, according to The Trace. Judy Martin, founder of Cleveland's Survivors/Victims of Tragedy Inc., and the secretary treasurer of Black on Black Crime of Cleveland, praised those involved in the March for Our Lives rallies for their efforts to bring attention to everyday gun violence in America's cities. \"I think its terrible for the reason they've had to do it -- but it is amazing and wonderful that the kids are marching. Our kids shouldn't be so afraid to go to school. They shouldn't feel like they've got to carry a gun because they're being bullied. They shouldn't be afraid to walk across the street, or stay in the house and pray that a bullet doesn't come through the wall,\" Martin said. She said she has been tracking homicides in Cuyahoga County since her son was killed in 1994. By her count, 1,809 children and adults under the age of 25 have been killed since 1990, and that demographic accounts for 43 percent of total homicides in the county since that year, Martin said. \"The kids have localized. And they're the future voters. When hundreds of thousands are marching all across the country, I think that speaks volumes,\" Martin said.

While on patrol, officers observed the erratic and reckless operation of a vehicle that was operating at speeds in excess of the city limit and blatantly ignoring posted stop signs.

After initially failing to stop for the officers, the vehicle finally pulled over near Pleasant Street and Savin Hill Avenue. When officers approached they observed four occupants known to the officers. The officers also noticed that the previously open window was now closed and the doors locked. Believing items may have been discarded from the vehicle, the officers retraced their path of travel. Within minutes, officers observed two loaded black semi-automatic firearms in front of 28 High Street in the same area where officers had observed the car window open. Both firearms had scratches consistent with being thrown from a moving vehicle, and thermal imaging showed that the firearms were warmer than their surrounding area, which indicates they had likely just been in a person\u2019s possession. Officers arrested the occupants of the motor vehicle, identified as a 16-year-old juvenile male from Dorchester, a 17-year-old juvenile male from Quincy, 26-year-old Ian Percival of Quincy, and 26-year-old Jonathan A.

(Martin Griff / The Times) TRENTON \u2013 A city woman has the dubious distinction of being Trenton\u2019s first shooting victim of 2014 when she was shot outside a South Ward restaurant early this morning, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the gunshot wound she received to the upper rib area was life-threatening, but the woman was conscious and alert when she was being taken to a city hospital, Lt. Mark Kieffer said. The woman, whose age was not available, was on the 800 block of Lamberton Street around 1 a.m. when a man in dark clothing fired a gun at her, Kieffer said. At least one bullet struck the woman. Police were called out, and an ambulance took the victim to Capital Health Regional Medical Center for treatment. Detectives are investigating and trying to determine a motive in the case. No other shootings were reported New Year\u2019s Eve 2013 into the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day in the capital city, Kieffer said.

Officers rushed the victim to Albert Einstein Medical Center, but he was pronounced dead a short time later.

A neighbor told us called 911 when he first heard gunshots, and that he then heard a second burst of gunfire while on the line. CBS3, 6ABC, NBC10 and Philly.com also have reports. This was the eighth homicide of 2014 reported in Philadelphia. Six of the first seven victims were also shot to death. Next, police rushed a 21-year-old man to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after he was shot several times just before 1 a.m. Wednesday on Osage Avenue near 53rd Street in West Philadelphia. The wounded man was listed in critical condition. Police said that the victim was shot multiple times on the porch of his house after opening the front door, according to a report from 6ABC, and added that the man will likely be paralyzed if he survives, according to NBC10. Another man was reported in critical condition Wednesday morning at Einstein after he was shot twice on Woodlawn Street, near McMahon Street and Chelten Avenue in East Germantown. A new study from the University of Pennsylvania finds that severely injured gunshot victims in Philadelphia have been more likely to survive when rushed to hospitals by police rather than medics, noting that police may have shorter response times by virtue of how they patrol. According to the report, patients transported police were still more likely to die \u2014 29.8 percent versus 26.5 percent \u2014 but this may be explained by the more severely injured victims that police typically transport, rather than the mode of transport itself. The study also notes that the Philadelphia Police Department has recently issued tourniquets to every police officer in the city. According to a Philadelphia Daily News report, police say that practice has already saved the life of one shooting victim as well as a man who was injured in an accident.

On Tuesday, a 30-year-old man was wounded about 6:40 p.m. as he sat in a parked car outside his house in Fort Duchesne's Turnkey subdivision, Facer said. The injured man, an enrolled member of the Colorado-based Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, was initially taken to Uintah Basin Medical Center in Roosevelt. He was later flown to a Salt Lake hospital, where he is recovering, Facer said. The FBI is not releasing any additional information about the incident. It is the second shooting on the reservation since Feb. 17, when a 15-year-old boy was wounded in the hand.

According to acting police Chief Brian Manley, officers were called out to the 6200 block of La Naranja Lane at 12:30 a.m. following a 911 call from a woman who said her son was threatening his father with a gun. She also said her son had additional ammunition around his neck. Officers arrived outside the home at 12:39 a.m. and waited for back up, Manley said. At 12:41 a.m., officers heard multiple gunshots inside the home. Officers spotted the suspect coming toward the front door at 12:45 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the man at 12:48 a.m. \"[It was] All at once, it was bam bam bam bam,\" a neighbor who lives around the corner from the suspect's home told KXAN. After the suspect went back inside the house, officers gave him commands to come out without his weapon. The suspect did come out with his hands in the air and was taken into custody. Chief Manley says Austin-Travis County EMS paramedics took the man to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. APD says the man was treated and released back into the department's custody. Officers were able to get the parents safely out of the home. \"It's just shocking,\" neighbor Brandy Benenate said. \"I'm glad he didn't lose his life. I hope he can recover and get whatever kind of help he needs.\" Many neighbors told KXAN La Naranja Lane and surrounding streets have always been quiet. They said the family involved in this shooting was a great neighbor. Manley said two officers were put on administrative leave after shooting the suspect. One is a six-year veteran with APD and the other has been on the force for less than a year. This is the fourth officer-involved shooting of 2018. The last one happened March 7, when a man allegedly ran at officers with a pickax. Eight officers in total were placed on administrative duty in that case, five of whom fired shots while the other three used less-lethal munitions.

Metal scrappers be warned, John West may be waiting with his gun if you try to steal from his West Volusia business. For the second time in about a year, Volusia County sheriff\u2019s deputies say West was waiting with his gun when a would-be metal thief showed up to burglarize his business. On Sunday, Dale Stewart, 43, of Orange City \u2014 who has scrapped about a ton of metal in the past month \u2014 was the unlucky suspect, according to a sheriff\u2019s charging affidavit. He now faces several charges in the incident that happened shortly after 9 a.m. at West Crane Services on Newport Avenue near the DeLand Municipal Airport. West told deputies he heard a noise outside of the business, and when he checked it out, he saw someone loading metal spreader bars into a pickup. According to a statement released by the Sheriff\u2019s Office, here are some outtakes from the 9-1-1 call: \u201cWe have somebody stealing stuff from our property,\u201d the 9-1-1 caller said to the dispatcher. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s caught in the act.\u201d A few moments later, the caller can be heard arguing with the suspect. \u201cIs he fighting y\u2019all or anything?\u201d the dispatcher said. \u201cNo, he\u2019s just mouthing off,\u201d the caller said. A DeLand Police officer was closest to the call and arrived on scene at 9:14 a.m. He found the owner of the business holding the suspect at gunpoint for officers, sheriff\u2019s spokesman Gary Davidson said. \u201cDuring questioning, Stewart told deputies that he was a self-employed handyman and that because business has been slow, he has been supplementing his income by scrapping metal,\u201d Davidson said. On Jan. 7, 2013, a similar scenario played out when West, 65, was guarding his business against theft. Two men had tried to steal a 300- to 400-pound wrecking ball from West Crane. Both were charged in the incident. West was out of the office working Monday and didn\u2019t immediately return a phone message. On Sunday in the incident with Stewart, deputies looked up transaction records and found that Stewart has scrapped nearly a ton of metal at local dealers in the past month, Davidson said. \u201cStewart said he saw the various metal items beside the business and claimed that he thought it was discarded junk, so he started loading it into his truck,\u201d Davidson said. But then the owner ordered him to get on the ground at gunpoint. Deputies found that the level of force was appropriate. The items recovered by deputies were worth about $500, the affidavit states. Stewart is charged with burglary and grand theft. A search of his truck turned up seven prescription muscle relaxers, so Stewart was also charged with possession of prescription medication without a valid prescription.

Coyne, 32, of Winthrop and formerly of Mercer, was sentenced Wednesday at the Capital Judicial Center for aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm that occurred Jan. 23, 2014, on Spring Street in Gardiner. Coyne Coyne had pleaded guilty to those charges on June 5, 2015. He also admitted violating probation and received a concurrent 42-month probation revocation. A sentencing memo by Coyne\u2019s attorney, Luann Calcagni, said the victim, Josh Belyea tried \u201cto grab the firearm in Mr. Coyne\u2019s hand resulting in a struggle, during which time the firearm inadvertently discharged.\u201d Belyea was shot in the leg. An affidavit by Gardiner Police Detective Michael Durham says Belyea told him that Coyne and Coyne\u2019s girlfriend had joined Belyea at another woman\u2019s Spring Street apartment, and the men became embroiled in a fight near the end of the evening. Belyea later told police he had been flirting with Coyne\u2019s girlfriend and that Coyne, who was intoxicated on the coffee brandy the two men had been drinking, objected, went to his car and returned to the apartment with a handgun. The shooting occurred about 12:25 a.m., and Coyne fled the scene before police and rescue personnel arrived. At the time, there were a number of outstanding warrants for Coyne\u2019s arrest. Calcagni had recommended an underlying sentence of 10 years but suggested suspending four of them. Instead, the judge imposed the full 10 years. \u201cThe state is pleased with the 10-year sentence on Paul Coyne as he is no longer a candidate for probation having failed to comply with conditions too many times in the past,\u201d District Attorney Maeghan Maloney said in a comment sent via email after the hearing. Coyne, who has a lengthy criminal record dating to 2003, was located a day later in a vehicle in Massachusetts. He was with his girlfriend and his brother. At the time, Massachusetts police said they recovered a 9 mm pistol, ammunition, a white powdery substance believed to be heroin and drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. In February 2013, Coyne was sentenced to four years in jail, with all but six months suspended, and two years of probation, for a conviction on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of scheduled drugs after reportedly stabbing a man in Winthrop during a fight related to drugs. In August 2009, Coyne was convicted on multiple charges including theft, eluding an officer and operating under the influence, after leading police on a 30-mile chase. During the pursuit, he rammed a police cruiser in Augusta. For that, he got 30 months in jail, a two-year license suspension and an order to pay restitution to the Maine State Police.

He was booked into the jail on those warrants and on charges of carrying a concealed weapon, failure to comply with police, possession of a controlled substance, marijuana paraphernalia possession, failure to wear a safety belt and having weapons under disability.

Davontae Sanford, now 25, was imprisoned in 2008 in Michigan after being wrongfully convicted of a quadruple homicide when he was 15, and served eight years before his release in 2016. According to a police report from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, officers acted on a complaint Monday about a marijuana odor coming from an address in Waddell, Ariz., northwest of Phoenix, in a subdivision mostly surrounded by open desert. Officers reported seeing Sanford and and two other men riding into the desert with a large duffel bag, and then returning with the bag empty. The men were allegedly shooting high-caliber rounds toward the subdivision, and shots were ricocheting in a park around children and young adults, \"and people were running for their lives,\" according to the report. Police searched the residence where Sanford was staying later Monday and found two AR15 rifles in addition to ammunition boxes and drum magazines, the report says. Sanford was charged in a Phoenix Court with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and endangerment, given $25,000 bail, and has a preliminary hearing March 30, according to Court records.

Kimberly P. Mitchell, DFP Sanford's exoneration in the Detroit homicides was the result of an 11-month re-investigation by Michigan State Police. Investigators found that former Detroit Police officer James Tolbert \u2014 an ex-Flint police chief \u2014 allegedly lied during sworn testimony. Tolbert had said Sanford drew a scene of the crime when it was, in fact, the police officer that drew the sketch. Following the investigation, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, with Sanford's attorneys, moved to dismiss charges against him. In September, Sanford was shot and wounded east of downtown Detroit. He has sued the city for damages in his wrongful conviction. Contact Omar Abdel-Baqui: 313-222-8850 or oabdelbaqu@freepress.com.

Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey said in a press conference Thursday that Nick Worthy, who was named Deputy of the Year in 2015, and his live-in girlfriend, Rachel Trexler, were taken into custody around 6 a.m., after authorities were called to their Viera home Wednesday night when neighbors reported hearing gunfire. Ivey said deputies were called to their home around 8:30 p.m. after neighbors said they heard the gunshots and a woman screaming. When they arrived at the couple's home, no one would come to the door, deputies said. Responding deputies told their supervisors that no one was answering, Ivey said. The supervisors then contacted officials with the Sheriff's Office investigative unit to obtain a search warrant, the sheriff said. After obtaining the warrant, deputies breached Worthy's home Thursday morning, Ivey said. When they entered the home, which the sheriff described as being in \"complete disarray,\" authorities found Worthy and Trexler inside with their 2-year-old child and three dogs, according to the sheriff. Investigators found weapons and ammunition lying around, evidence of gunshots that appeared to be consistent with what neighbors described hearing, and a small amount of drugs and paraphernalia, Ivey said. In addition to trash, litter and food, dog feces could also be seen \"all over\" the home, the sheriff said. Ivey called the couple's living conditions \"extremely disgusting,\" especially for a member of law enforcement who is also a parent. \"It was absolutely conditions that no one should live in, especially not somebody that has a profession such as ours and certainly, with absolute conviction, not somebody that has a small child that was exposed to that type of environment, that type of element,\" Ivey said. Worthy and Trexler were both arrested and face charges of child neglect, possession of cocaine and marijuana under 20 grams and possession of paraphernalia, according to the Sheriff's Office. The child is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families, the sheriff said. Ivey said the three dogs were turned over to BCSO's Animal Services unit. Ivey said Worthy was fired immediately after his arrest. The sheriff said he is asking the State Attorney's Office to fully prosecute the case. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we will police our own,\" Ivey said. Ivey said investigators are still working to determine whether a domestic incident took place, but that authorities' main concern was relocating the child and the couple's pets to safe environments. Worthy, who had been with the Sheriff's Office since 2012, was last assigned to the east precinct as a Road deputy, the sheriff said. He was named \"Deputy of the Year\" by the Brevard County Sheriff's Office in 2015, according to a news release.

Driving around the area to see if he could find someone related to that, Quinley spotted a man on a bicycle whom he identified as Rommell Smith. Smith, 23, now homeless, had been wanted by police in connection with cannabis and a gun that police found in the Vawter Street apartment where Smith was living in February. Morgan said about 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 2, police were sent to an apartment complex in the 2000 block of Vawter Street where several shots had been fired. No one was present but within minutes, police located Smith at a nearby convenience store with cuts and abrasions, some of which happened when he fell running away. Smith reported he was in the Vawter apartment when several men forced their way in. Morgan said Smith fought, pulling a gun to defend himself. In the struggle over the gun with one of the intruders, several shots were fired. The intruders fled, as did Smith, Morgan said. About 15 minutes after the shots-fired call, a man with multiple gunshot wounds was dropped off at the emergency room entrance at Carle Foundation Hospital, Morgan said. \"In spite of being shot five times, he got up and walked in,\" said Morgan, declining to identify that man, who survived the shots. Morgan said Smith was being treated there at the same time for cuts to his hands. Meantime, back at the Vawter apartment, police searched and found more than 500 grams of cannabis, packaging materials and .380-caliber ammunition. Smith was not arrested that day. Morgan said about two weeks later, on Feb. 14, police were sent to another shots-fired call at an apartment in the 1700 block of East Florida Avenue. Morgan said police learned that Smith had been staying at the apartment where a shot went through the floor into the apartment below.

Gig Harbor residents Guang Zheng, 45, and Dan Yu, 37, were arraigned Wednesday in Pierce County Superior Court. The Taiwanese nationals each face seven felony charges and seven misdemeanor charges of unlawful operation of a licensed business, and their bail was set at $100,000 each. Prosecutors noted in charging documents that they reserve the right to add charges of promoting prostitution, human trafficking and leading organized crime, as well as felony firearms charges. Scroll down to continue reading More news from KIRO 7 DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP According to charging documents and Lakewood police: Lakewood police began investigating the Treat Your Feet massage parlor at 8904 South Tacoma Way in October 2015, using undercover detectives to get massages from the business. Records and surveillance footage showed that Zheng and Yu were responsible for transporting the massage parlor\u2019s employees to and from work. The two were almost always operating the front desk at the parlor, escorting customers to massage rooms or speaking in a foreign language to the employees to get them to escort the customers to the massage rooms. The same seven people were almost always working at the parlor, and the police officers got at least two massages from each masseuse, none of whom were licensed with the state Department of Health. (Yu maintained a license, but she never gave a massage to any of the undercover officers.) The first time an unlicensed masseuse gives a massage, it is a misdemeanor in Washington state, with each subsequent massage given is deemed a felony. During the investigation, Lakewood police detectives were solicited for prostitution. After watching Zheng and Yu regularly go to apartments near the massage parlor, Lakewood police on Tuesday served search warrants there. In the first apartment were four women who lived there, and in the second were a man and woman. The seventh employee was later contacted at the massage parlor. Police interviewed the people through an interpreter, and each said they lived at the apartments, and money was taken from their paychecks to pay for rent.

Now about two weeks later, she fears her daughter has been forgotten. \u201cI have done everything in my power to keep my kids safe,\u201d said Stingley, a single mother who also has two sons, 6 and 18. \u201cThis is the one time I couldn\u2019t.

It was shortly before 1 a.m. \u201cI asked her where she was and told her I loved her and to be careful.

She could only think of what more she could have done to save her daughter.

The man and her daughter, along with other friends, had been at the lake on the day of the shooting and were on their way home. None of the people who were with her daughter that night has contacted her to share information about what led up to the shooting, Stingley said. \u201cI want the people in the car to sit down with me and the police.

State Department of Education spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said the boy showed up Tuesday morning at Roosevelt High School. Officials there recognized him as a runaway who was not registered for classes, and called police. Maj. Richard Robinson, commander of the Honolulu Police Department's Criminal Investigations Division, said the boy lunged at officers who arrived at the public high school near downtown Honolulu and tried to take him into custody. Robinson said the teen attacked one of the officers with a knife, leaving him with a minor cut on his torso. He also hit two other officers, but neither suffered serious injuries, he said. One of the officers then fired two shots, hitting the boy once in the wrist. The teen was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, Robinson said. The shooting prompted a lockdown at Roosevelt, which has an enrollment of about 1,500. Kealii Akiona-Soares, said he was in social studies class when he heard a faint shot at about 8:20 a.m. Then a school bell sounded and students were kept in their classrooms, the 17-year-old junior said. He said his class continued with a politics lessons, and everyone kept mostly calm. \"I guess it happens a lot in mainland schools, so it's not surprising,\" Akiona-Soares said. Several parents, including Carolyn Richardson, gathered outside after word of the shooting spread. \"This is really freaking me out,\" Richardson told the AP. Richardson said she learned about the shooting around 9 a.m. through a text from her son, CarDarow, a sophomore. CarDarow told her he heard shots had been fired at the school, but that he was OK. She then used her cellphone to video chat with him. \"I told him, I gotta hear your voice,\" Richardson said. Other parents outside the school also texted and talked on their phones to their children while they were on lockdown inside the school. School was let out for the day at about 10 a.m., and a steady stream of students filed out of campus, with many reuniting with their parents.

Among the weapons found at the apartment of Michael Santos, listed in public records as the owner of Nugent's Tavern in Elizabeth, was a Ruger mini 14, according to an affidavit of probable cause. That gun was \"immediately identified as a weapon listed on the assault weapons ban list,\" stated the document, which said Elizabeth police also found three high-capacity magazines in the apartment at 910 Sheridan Avenue. Santos, 43, was charged with simple assault, terroristic threats, resisting arrest and unlawful possession of a weapon. A scheduled Court appearance on Wednesday was postponed due to the weather. According to the affidavit, Santos yelled at a neighbor attempting to quell the domestic dispute while racking, or preparing to use, a gun behind the door of his apartment, and threatened to shoot him if he came into the residence. The inquiring man, identified by the initials C.E., intervened in a dispute between Santos and a woman identified in the document only as R.F. The documents do not state the relationship between Santos and R.F. R.F. and Santos had gotten into an argument because she had a broken foot and Santos refused to take her to the hospital, the report states. C.E. and R.F. had been outside the apartment, and when they went inside, the report states, R.F. threw two glass bottles at Santos but missed him. He then grabbed her from behind and bit her back. C.E. was able to break up the fight, and R.F. went to the bathroom. C.E. was on his way back to his apartment when he heard the woman yell his name. As he made his way back up the stairs to the apartment, the report states, C.E. heard Santos racking a gun after stating, \"If you come in this house I'm going to shoot you.\" C.E. then called the police. When police responded, Santos refused to open the door to the apartment. Police eventually entered the apartment and placed Santos under arrest, according to the report. When police asked R.F. if there were weapons in the home, she stated there were several in the safe and garage. A local news report identified Nugent's as a \"city landmark since 1933 (that) has been a popular spot for military and police.\" The famed watering hole was a family owned establishment that began as the Highway Inn in 1928. It became Nugent's Tavern following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Santos reopened Nugent's Tavern after it had been boarded up for 15 years. It was damaged by a basement fire in 2011.

Manley said three officers responded to the area a minute after the call and made their way to the back half of the duplex. Manley said when officers started knocking on doors, people informed them that they were at the wrong residence. Therefore, the officers made their way to the other side of the duplex and knocked on the suspect's door multiple times, waiting for an answer. After several rounds of knocking and not seeing any persons inside the home, Manley said the officers turned to leave the home. However, as they were walking away, a person fired shots from inside the residence at the officers. The suspect shot a five-year veteran officer in the right arm, according to Manley. \"The officers ran from the front of the house and jumped over a fence, and called it in. At that point, we had multiple units responding to the scene,\" Manley said. Manley added that at least one officer fired shots at the suspect's home as they ran from the scene. Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services took two officers to Street David's South Austin Medical Center: one suffered a gunshot wound while the other officer, a 16-year veteran, hurt his hand and knee after climbing over a fence. Both officers are expected to be OK. Manley said because the person fired shots at officers and refused to leave his home, the Austin Police Department called in the SWAT team to help. SWAT officers said they heard gunshots going off in the home as they attempted to retrieve the suspect. Police evacuated residents in the surrounding area as a precautionary measure. Manley said the SWAT team used a robot to break into the home after receiving a tip that there was a second person inside the home. Officials said they wanted to know if the gunfire inside the home injured the female and if she needed medical attention. After the robot broke into the home, Manley said the suspect exited the home with a female. A SWAT officer fired at the suspect, forcing him to fall to the ground. Police took the woman into protective custody, Manley said.

In the weeks that followed, organizers hosted a \"do over\" of the parade and multiple fundraisers were held for the injured even as police conducted a manhunt for the shooting suspects. In Court records, FnD members who have pleaded guilty have admitted to selling drugs over a territory bounded by Elysian Fields Avenue, North Johnson, Interstate 10, Street Anthony Street and North Claiborne Avenue. The center of the gang's operation was the Frenchmen Meat Market, where workers would hold guns behind the counter for FnD members, and would let patrons swap food stamps for cash that they then handed over to FnD members for heroin or crack. Surveillance video from the store's own cameras was noted as evidence prosecutors intended to use at trial, with footage showing FnD members making numerous drug deals inside the store. Travis Scott often carried an AK-47 rifle he called \"monkey nuts,\" a reference to the massive drum magazine that could hold 100 rounds, according to Court records. Akein Scott, now 22, sold drugs at the store several days a week, mostly in the afternoon after returning from school, one unnamed witness said in Court records. As one of the younger members of the gang, Akein often was told to hang onto firearms for older gang members, because as a juvenile, he would face less serious penalties from authorities if he was caught with the weapons. In Court records, Akein Scott admitted to pulling the trigger himself in four shootings during the year before the 2013 Mother's Day parade, joining Shawn and Stanley Scott in a shootout in front of the Frenchmen Meat Market in which a 14-year-old girl riding in a passing vehicle was shot in the leg. On Mother's Day 2013, Akein Scott is seen on surveillance video as the second-line parade moves down the block, stepping out from the side of a building with a pistol raised and firing into the terrified marchers, according to Court records. When asked about his background by Judge Lemelle on Wednesday, Akein Scott was the only one of the brothers to have completed high school, stating that he attended college in \"Talladega\" and studied business administration. His lawyer, Julie Tizzard, said Akein Scott had been enrolled in college when he was arrested in 2014.

Jones, 25, is awaiting a federal jury trial scheduled for Oct. 5 to answer an eight-count indictment alleging interstate trafficking of juvenile girls for the purposes of sex and prostitution. Authorities allege that Jones drugged, beat and intimidated two girls age 16 and 17 to provide him income through prostitution. Investigators described Jones as a pimp who also goes by the names \"Lucci,\" \"King Lucci\" and \"Lucci Loco.\" The two-day trial was not without challenges for Orleans Parish prosecutors Taylor Anthony and Bonycle Thornton. The shooting victim, who was left without feeling in his lower extremities because of a bullet lodged in his spine, refused to testify against Jones. Prosecutors said the victim was another alleged pimp, who angered Jones by taking his clothing from a hotel room after Jones was arrested on weapons charges on Feb. 11, 2014. Federal agents and NOPD officers raided that hotel room in the 300 block of Street Joseph Street in the Warehouse District on Feb. 11, 2014, seeking to arrest Christopher Williams, a third alleged pimp who was wanted on sex trafficking and prostitution allegations. While searching for Williams, police said they found a pistol and an AK-47 rifle in the closet of a room registered to Jones. Because Jones had a previous felony robbery conviction in Tennessee, he was barred from possessing firearms and arrested on suspicion of illegal weapons possession. Jones posted bond within days, but not before threatening the man who took his clothing in a recorded jailhouse call, prosecutors said. Six days after his arrest for weapons poession, Jones shot the victim at a home in the 2500 block of Gladiolus Street, police said. Prosecutors said Jones fled back to Memphis after the shooting, violating terms of his bond on the New Orleans weapons arrests. Jones was captured in Tennessee and extradited back to Louisiana in April 2014. While jailed, Jones used a contraband phone to speak with Williams, admitting he shot the third pimp who made off with his clothes, prosecutors said. But when Williams was subpoenaed to testify Wednesday, he refused to utter a word from the witness stand. Judge Herman found Williams in contempt of Court and sentenced him to six months in Orleans Parish Prison to run consecutive to his other sentences. Jones was supposed to have gone on trial May 27. That date had to be reset after Jones was beaten and stabbed in the lower left side of his back inside Orleans Parish Prison on the night before jury selection was to begin. Herman granted a continuance after that attack at the request of Jones' attorney, Michael Idoyaga, and ordered jail officials \"to take whatever steps necessary to ensure (Jones') safety.\"", "publish_date": "2015-08-27"}, {"text": "Danielle Dawson, 33, of Grimes and Andrew Wickett, 29, of Madrid, were arrested after allegedly robbing a woman and holding her at gunpoint in her Grimes apartment.

Petit-Frere is one of the suspects that North Miami Beach Police say took part in a kidnapping in the parking lot of a local restaurant about two weeks ago. Authorities say he and another suspect ordered a woman into a car, and drove her to separate location where she was sexually battered by multiple people. \"I just pray that he didn't do it. I don't think that he would. From me being here and living around him, I don't see him doing that,\" Tamika Wilson said of Petit-Frere Wednesday. Christian Artega, a friend from his apartment complex, also defended him.

There was a long list of rules posted on the window warning those reading not to knock past midnight. Miami-Dade Police say Petit-Frere wasn't good at obeying rules in their jurisdiction. They have charged him with armed robbery, armed kidnapping and false imprisonment over a separate November incident that happened at the Oak Grove apartment complex at 15455 Northeast 6th Avenue in Miami-Dade. According to the arrest affidavit, Petit-Frere and an accomplice confronted a woman as she walked to her apartment. The 17-year-old allegedly pointed a firearm at the victim, demanding property and her keys, and later forced her into the trunk of her own vehicle. After driving to a bank, where they withdrew money from her account, police said, the teen ordered the woman to pull down her pants and underwear. She complied out of fear, and he demanded that she use her fingers to masturbate as he touched her leg, according to police. Petit-Frere was arrested Tuesday after he was followed by undercover North Miami Beach detectives when they spotted him in a blue Nissan, police said. Both North Miami Beach and Miami-Dade detectives questioned him after he was taken into custody. \"The only thing he mentioned he had a baby on the way. A little girl and that was it,\" said Wilson, about the last conversation she had with Petit-Frere.

Police said Romero shot at three officers, and the officers shot back, killing him.

They said he spoke English well, so he would have understood police commands. They said they heard about 20 shots fired when police confronted him.

Before police arrived, Romero shot his 19-year-old daughter inside the home. Ana Alvarado was taken to UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, but she had been released by Thursday.

In one of those incidents, five juveniles were injured. In another, police say the victim is actually the suspect.

We're told the man is receiving care at Froedtert Hospital and is reportedly in grave condition. Because he is considered a suspect, his family is not allowed to see him -- something they are not happy about. \"If you know anything - I`m begging you, anything at all - call the Milwaukee Police Department,\" Susie Sebring said. Sebring's nephew is the man who was shot on Tuesday night. Police say Ikeem Cantrell was shot near West Leon Terrace Road. \"That`s really the only facts and details we have gotten so far. They`re not letting anyone see him yet,\" Sebring said. Sebring and other family members are being denied access to Cantrell because he is considered a suspect in the case. Police say Cantrell was shot multiple times by his intended victim. Investigators believe Cantrell was shot in self-defense. Police say Cantrell has a lengthy criminal record with a history of armed robbery and weapons violations. \"Right now, everybody is upset and grieving and everything. We really don`t know the full details about everything,\" Sebring said. This incident wasn't the only shooting Tuesday night. Police are also investigating an incident in which five juveniles suffered gunshot wounds after a shotgun went off in the basement of a home near Locust and N. 28th Street. \"The police are still investigating how these five young people got possession of this shotgun,\" Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said.

They quickly spotted surveillance cameras and discovered that the doors and windows were fortified with locks and steel bars. More than 30 firearms, including handguns, rifles and assault weapons with high-capacity magazines, were removed from the apartment. Thousands of rounds of ammunition, cocaine, marijuana, marijuana wax, molly, prescription drugs, and portable compressed gas tanks were also confiscated in the raid.

(Photos courtesy of Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office) Three men accused of staging a brazen home-invasion burglary in the Garden District found themselves behind bars less than two hours later, New Orleans police announced Thursday (Feb. 6). And their victims, though manhandled and bound during the robbery, found the assailants surprisingly personable, if not criminally adept. Police said the burglary unfolded around 6 p.m. Wednesday in the 1300 block of Sixth Street. Police said a man knocked at the front door of a newly renovated Victorian home and asked the 68-year-old woman who answered if \"Brian\" was home. She told the man nobody by that name lived there, and the man left. Three men, one armed with a handgun, forced their way into a home in the 1300 block of Sixth Street, binding and robbing the homeowners, police said. (Google Maps) About 20 minutes later, there was another knock at the door. This time, according to the homeowners, the same man and two accomplices -- one armed with a handgun -- shoved their way past the woman into the house. Using dog leashes found in the home, the men tied up the woman and her 71-year-old husband. They ordered the couple into a first-floor study and began filling a bag with valuables, including a handgun, cameras, cell phones and iPad tablets. \"They spoke Spanish to each other,\" said the husband, who is not being identified by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune because he is a victim of a crime. \"But the one that talked to us, he was actually very nice and reassuring. He told us not to look at them. And he kept saying, 'Where's the money? Where's the money?' \"I told him, 'The only money I had was in my wallet, and you already took that.'\" The ordeal was over in about five minutes, the husband said. And though the couple was shaken, they were not injured. NOPD Officer Justin Brown responded to the call. And once he learned what was taken, the electronic chase was on, using a popular free app as an investigative tool. The husband told police one of the devices stolen had been plugged in, and was only in \"sleep\" mode. Using the free \"Find My iPhone\" app installed on the device, investigators began tracing the movement of the stolen items to a location in Fat City. New Orleans police coordinated with officers of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, and tracked down three men matching the suspects' descriptions leaving a black Ford Mustang in the 3300 block of Edenborn Avenue. Next to a nearby dumpster, police and deputies also found a duffel bag containing some of the couple's stolen items. Police booked Luis Guevara, 20; Kevin Aguilar, 23; and 22-year-old Orlyn Izaguirre each on two counts of armed robbery and one count of aggravated burglary. Police said the woman recognized one of the men as someone who had previously done renovation work at the home as a contractor or painter, NOPD Lt. Frank Young said. New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas praised his officers' quick response and ingenuity, noting that electronic tracking capabilities of phones, tablets, laptop computers and cars continues to aid in apprehension of thieves. \"(These officers) did what I would classify as amazing police work,\" Serpas said. \"In short order, three very dangerous men were taken off the streets. ... The message to criminals is to just quit stealing stuff, because we're going to find you.\" Speaking Thursday on the front porch of his home, the husband said this was the first time he had been touched by crime in New Orleans. But he and his wife were unhurt, most of their stolen property already had been returned, and he was grateful for the way things turned out. \"It was some experience,\" he said. \"I would rather not have had it, but the resulting outcome was successful. The NOPD was great, in concert with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Department.\" As for his assailants? \"Well, they weren't very good armed robbers,\" he said. \"For what little they got, it didn't end up being worth it.\"", "publish_date": "2014-02-07"}, {"text": "IN ANSON, Sunday at 7:02 p.m., trespassing was reported on Bailey Drive.

One shot was fired early Tuesday inside an Indiana County apartment during an altercation between two men, which led to a six-hour standoff with state police in bitter, subzero temperatures, Trooper John Matchik said. Black tape covered a peephole at Matthew B. Palmeri\u2019s Byron Court apartment in White Township on Tuesday morning, where Palmeri peacefully surrendered about 7 a.m. \u201cFortunately, in this case, the victim was not injured and none of our troopers were injured,\u201d Matchik said. Police confiscated about 10 weapons from Palmeri\u2019s apartment, including assault rifles and semi-automatic shotguns. Palmeri is being held in the Indiana County Jail on $100,000 bail on aggravated assault and related charges. According to an affidavit of probable cause, Palmeri and his 27-year-old male friend were doing shots of liquor at Palmeri\u2019s Spring Meadow apartment when his dog, a Siberian husky, urinated on the living room carpet. \u201cThis agitated Palmeri to the point where he grabbed the dog by the collar and began pushing it around,\u201d Trooper Jason Morgan wrote in the complaint. The victim took the husky and his dog to his nearby apartment, police said. Upon the victim\u2019s return, \u201cPalmeri was standing in the hallway of the apartment \u2026 holding a semi-automatic handgun at his side,\u201d Morgan wrote. The victim attempted to grab the gun from Palmeri and said a struggle ensued over the weapon inside the apartment, according to police. A shot was fired after Palmeri regained control, but the victim\u2019s hand was still on the gun. Police said the round went past the victim\u2019s head. Investigators are not sure if the gun was intentionally fired, Matchik said. The victim fled and summoned police at 12:30 a.m. He was seen at the apartment complex later Tuesday morning walking two dogs, but declined to speak with reporters. When police arrived, some residents fled their building and others were ordered to stay in their apartments while officers attempted unsuccessfully to speak with Palmeri. Matchik said Palmeri may have been asleep while investigators were trying to reach him by phone and public address system. Palmeri surrendered after police made contact with him. Neighbor Austin Eaddy said Palmeri was considered a hero by complex residents on Sunday. Palmeri broke a window on a sliding glass door and rescued a dog from an apartment fire, said Eaddy and his roommate, Jeremiah McPhearson. \u201cHe was a hero; people were really clapping for him,\u201d Eaddy said. The roommates said they heard arguing and a gunshot early Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m asleep; I think I hear people arguing in my dreams,\u201d Eaddy said. \u201cI spoke to him (Palmeri) a couple times. I didn\u2019t know he was that heavily armed,\u201d McPhearson said. According to a biography on Palmeri\u2019s photography website, he grew up on Long Island and became an emergency medical technician and volunteer firefighter. Palmeri did not have an attorney listed on online Court records. He is charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment and harassment. Indiana District Judge Guy Haberl arraigned him by video at 10:30 a.m. and set a preliminary hearing for Feb. 6. Renatta Signorini is a staff writer for Trib Total Media. Brian F.

When police arrived at the 4200 block of Mayfield Drive, residents had detained Smith, an officer told the court. Witnesses told police that after the woman discovered Smith breaking into the car, her son chased after the suspect, who allegedly was using both a heavy coat and a jacket to conceal the objects he had stolen from six vehicles. At some point during the chase, Smith's pants allegedly fell around his ankles. The son then allegedly noticed a handgun in Smith's possession, and tackled him. He managed the wrestle the weapon away from Smith before striking him in the head, an officer told the court.

Together, the three face 11 charges, including alleged drug and gun offenses. Police wanted Paul Coyne, who had seven warrants out for his arrest, in connection with a shooting Thursday morning on Spring Street in Gardiner, but he had not been charged with it as of Friday. The victim, a 26-year-old man whom police haven\u2019t identified, was found early Thursday shot in the leg in his apartment at 32 Spring St., but the gunman wasn\u2019t there. The victim was taken to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, and was expected to make a full recovery. He has been interviewed by police, said Gardiner Police Chief James Toman. Dwight Fowles, acting director of security for the Maine Department of Corrections, said Friday that after the shooting probation officers and investigators began searching for information on Coyne\u2019s whereabouts. Coyne was on probation, and an officer learned that Coyne and Brown had left Maine and were in the Lowell, Mass., area. Police said after the shooting they believed that Coyne was a passenger in a silver Chevrolet sedan. That matched the description of the car Massachusetts police found Friday morning. Massachusetts State Police said they recovered a 9 mm pistol, ammunition, a white powdery substance believed to be heroin and drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. On Friday, Paul Coyne was charged with knowingly being around heroin, conspiracy to violate drug laws, disguising his identity to obstruct justice and being a fugitive from justice. Brown was cited on two gun charges, two drug charges and a knife violation, and Michael Coyne on two drug charges, Massachusetts State Police said.

In August 2009, he was convicted on multiple charges, including theft, eluding an officer and operating under the influence, after leading police on a 30-mile chase.

I can only respond in generalities to this because the rights of all students are the same relative to releasing information in their records - it's private. That being said, it is extremely rare to allow individuals access to a building for any purpose if they participated in substantially disrupting the school.\" DeKeyser also provided this statement to MLive.com: \"This unfortunate incident tested many of our resources and we passed all of them, so far. The next test is how we grow to become better at preventing behaviors that result in threats of violence and, perhaps, the identification of warning signs which could preempt them. We have a great partnership with our local police and fire/EMT force in Northfield Twp.

After a pursuit that went from West Glacier over Marias Pass and into Glacier County, James Marlowe Ness, 71, was shot during an exchange of gunfire with officers from Blackfeet Tribal Police and the Glacier County Sheriff\u0092s Office. \u0093Ness was struck during the exchange and died upon arrival at the hospital,\u0094 according to a press release late Friday from the FBI. Flathead County deputies and Montana Highway Patrol troopers also were at the scene on U.S. 2 midway between Marias Pass and East Glacier. The drama began to unfold at 7:57 p.m. Thursday when an OnStar representative called the Flathead County 911 dispatch and said Ness had been reported missing to the Helena Police Department and was suicidal, armed with a shotgun. Ness was driving a white 2012 GMC Yukon that had been tracked to Montana 35, heading north toward Kalispell. The OnStar caller also told the dispatcher that the man had not made any statements to hurt himself, but his wife said he was depressed, had a history of alcohol abuse and was on an antidepressant medication. Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry said deputies caught up with Ness on U.S. 2 in West Glacier, where a pursuit began that reached speeds of more than 90 miles per hour. Deputies eventually slowed and lost sight of Ness. \u0093We actually backed off, because of the speeds, around Essex, maybe a little before,\u0094 Curry said. \u0093Just passing Essex, they lost sight of him.\u0094 According to Montana Department of Transportation Road reports, U.S. 2 at the time had blowing and drifting snow as well as ice. Curry said a spike strip was laid out by law enforcement just inside Glacier County, but Ness was able to avoid the strip while still traveling at a high rate of speed. A dispatch log indicates Ness later drove over a spike strip six miles east of Marias Pass, stopping his vehicle. What exactly transpired between Ness and law enforcement after he stopped isn\u0092t entirely clear, although a dispatch log indicates that at one point he got out of the vehicle and pointed a shotgun at Glacier County deputies before getting back into the parked vehicle. Curry said that while his deputies eventually responded to the scene, they initially stopped at the county line while awaiting a request for assistance from their Glacier County counterparts. \u0093We had our dispatch contact them, and finally Glacier County said, \u0091Yes, they\u0092d like us to continue,\u0092\u0094 Curry said. \u0093Our guys got on scene and said there were more patrol cars than they\u0092d seen in their lives. They only expected there would be a couple of officers.\u0094 He said that his deputies helped facilitate with OnStar but weren\u0092t involved in the shooting. An investigation by the FBI is continuing, and a coroner\u0092s inquest is being conducted by the Toole County coroner. The incident affected traffic on U.S. 2 for hours.

It just so happened that the victim was home alone inside her house asleep when someone sprayed the house with bullets. Some of the bullets went next door, striking the car in the driveway and the neighbor's front door. \"These two are under my daughter's bed,\" Antionne Nailor said as tears fell from his face just at the thought of his daughter possibly being in the path of gunfire. Antionne Nailor broke down crying while pointing out where the two bullets struck inside his daughter's bedroom and struck the girl's mother as she slept in their daughter's bed. \"She got hit in her back and in the back of her neck two shots,\" Nailor said. Their Maura Lane home is full of bullet holes after someone opened fire on the house just before 2 a.m. Since Antionne's daughter stayed at her grandmother's, the girl's mother stayed in her room for the night as Antionne picked up an extra shift at work. \"She got hit in my daughter's bed where she would have been that night,\" said Nailor. \"We all would have been here tonight. I only worked for somebody else and I didn't want to do it and if I would have been here, I would have been dead.\" There are bullet holes in the windows, the front door, and all over the front siding of Antionne's home. \"Now I have bullet holes - more than I can count,\" he said. \"More than I want to count.\" Some of the gunfire hit next door, striking the windshield of a 2010 Dodge Charger.

DALTON, Ga. Man arrested after firing shots A Chatsworth, Ga., man was arrested late Saturday in Dalton after he allegedly pulled a gun and fired into the air in the parking lot of Chili's restaurant near College Drive. Steven Andrew Holland, 24, was charged with three counts of aggravated assault, reckless conduct, simple assault, and discharging a weapon on the property of another, according to a news release from the Dalton Police Department. The incident began in the restaurant and spilled outside, the release from spokesman Bruce Frazier said. Holland told officers a group of people inside had been harassing his wife and some people followed them into the parking lot as they were trying to leave, Frazier said. Holland told officers four or five people surrounded him as he tried to get into his SUV and one hit him on the head. He said he pulled a 9 mm handgun from a holster in his jeans and fired two shots into the air. However, other witnesses disputed that story, telling investigating officers that Holland was the one who swung first before being punched and pulling out his gun, according to Frazier. Officers determined that disagreement led back to a fight that Holland's wife, Celeste Holcomb, had had with Megan Bowling at a football game in Murray County several years ago. Bowling and members of her group saw Holcomb and Holland at the restaurant, which led to the exchange of words and the shots. Holland surrendered without incident when police arrived at 11:10 p.m., Frazier said. His wife, who was driving away in the SUV, also was stopped by police. MILLINGTON, Tenn.

The suspect was transported to Magnolia Regional Health Center via EMS.\" They wanted to talk to Chris Burrell about a disturbance a few miles away, but Burrell's family doesn't think police handled the situation properly. Towonna Jones is Burrell's mother-in-law. \"Chris, if he knew that was a police officer out here, he would have never had that gun right there,\" said Jones. She said Corinth Police didn't have to shoot him twice Thursday night when they came to his mobile home on Clay Road. \"I don't trust the police,\" said Jones.

Burrell's cousin, Jamie Bradley, said that's not true because Chris was home all night. We're told Burrell has a disability, doesn't work, and doesn't get out much. \"He don't go nowhere. he takes his medicine about seven-thirty, his sleeping medicine, and he don't leave the house after that,\" said Jamie Bradley. Officers fired at Burrell after he came to the front door with a pistol in his hand. Burrell's wife and 4-year old son were on the couch in the living room when the shooting started. Crystal Burrell told Jamie Bradley that her husband thought someone he had been arguing with was at the door, and that whoever was there was connected to the disturbance call on Allen Street. \"He didn't have no clue who was at the door, he just heard somebody coming up the steps. He opened the door and cops was right in his face,\" said Jamie Bradley. Corinth Police have not released the officers names involved in the shooting or how many shots were fired. But Friday, Jamie Bradley pointed out several bullet holes in the front window of the mobile home. \"There's a bullet hole right there. That's one, two, three, four, five,\" said Bradley. There were plenty of other bullet holes inside the mobile home including the kitchen where Burrell was found.

Local police in Smyrna, Georgia, found Heavenlee Benjamin, 14, at the home of Robert Gooden, who turned a gun on himself the moment officers entered his house to arrest him on a misdemeanor charge of criminal restraint, according to Maine State Police Sgt. Blaine Bronson. Benjamin was not injured, police said. Gooden met the teen online in late February, then traveled to Maine and took her back to Georgia, Bronson said, adding that Benjamin appears to have gone with him willingly. She was reported missing from her Readfield foster home on Feb. 28, the day after Gooden took a bus to Maine to meet her, he said. Authorities know little about Gooden or what motivated him, Bronson said. But Benjamin\u2019s disappearance launched one of the most extensive, involved searches for a missing Maine teenager he\u2019s seen over his 22-year career in law enforcement.

Arriving, officers discovered 25-year-old Keres Mantil Holloway lying in the entrance of the lobby with a gunshot to his arm and chest. He was transported to the University of South Alabama Medical Center where he died from his wounds. Roughly 48 hours later, police were on the scene of another shooting. This time, officers arrived to the 300 block of Ridge Street to find 19-year-old Dave Populus dead from a gunshot. In a year that started relatively slow, the past three months have seen 13 murders in the Mobile police jurisdiction, contributing to a near mid-year total of 18. While the city is not quite on pace to break any annual homicide records, Police Chief James Barber said there are some obvious trends in 2014\u2019s cases. Advertisements \u201cThe big trend with homicide we\u2019ve seen lately is drug-related homicide,\u201d he said. \u201cMost homicides are between parties who are known to each other and often they are heat-of-the-moment, passion-type crimes \u2026 but we\u2019ve been challenged pretty heavily by the introduction of spice from an over-the-counter drug that went to street-level dealers.\u201d In six of the 18 cases, including the two most recent, no arrests have been made, but Barber indicated some of those homicides may be related to more widespread criminal activity that is currently the subject of a larger investigation. He singled out back-to-back murders on Next Street in May and several others in the vicinity of Webb Avenue as being particularly unusual. \u201cAll of them are in a nexus of spice-related criminal organizations, and that\u2019s an extensive operation because of the criminal organization involved,\u201d he said of the ongoing investigation. \u201cIt involves intelligence as well as the homicide unit.\u201d Barber spoke of taking an \u201coffender-oriented approach,\u201d to solving those murders, where the organizations are \u201cattacked\u201d by the department\u2019s intelligence to develop the information homicide needs in order to prosecute the suspects. \u201cThere are two main components of homicide and if you can figure out why it happened and how it happened, you can usually determine who did it,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have enough evidence to prosecute. You also have to rely on witness testimony, forensic evidence and statements from the defendant, if they are willing to provide them.\u201d Except for three, all of Mobile\u2019s murder victims in 2014 have died from gunshot wounds. The exceptions were 19-year-old Tyrone Gable, who succumbed to blood loss after jumping through a glass window to escape a domestic altercation June 9, 23-month-old Christian Henderson, a toddler who appears to have been beaten and 23-year-old Quentavious Battiste, who was stabbed by his girlfriend. The aggressor in the Gable case, 20-year-old Jimmie Lee Taite, was charged with felony murder even though he never directly attacked the victim. \u201cFrom a police standpoint, we see people with no criminal record at all commit homicide,\u201d Barber said, noting that Gable died while Taite was committing a breaking-and-entering and assault on another individual on the property. Mobile reported a total of 27 homicides in 2013, which was down from a 10-year high of 42 in 2008. This year, five cases initially reported as homicide have been dismissed as justifiable, a number Barber said was \u201cextremely high.\u201d \u201cHomicide by definition merely means the killing of one human being by another and by itself is not a crime,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Justifiable\u2019 means that if you are trying to protect yourself from serious injury or death whereas unjustifiable are those with any malice or intent and those are called \u2018murder\u2019 under the criminal statute we use.\u201d Barber said any perceived \u201cuptick\u201d in the number of recent murders is the result of \u201cdisorganized, violent, inner-city crime,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t dismiss the cases as typical. \u201cI think there is every reason in the world to be alarmed,\u201d he said, repeating his talking point that spice could be as threatening to the community as crack cocaine was in the 1980s. Since then, \u201cwe have had a lot of success but now we have spice entering the scene and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing this large effort to stop it before it becomes an epidemic.\u201d 2014 Homicides by date: \u2022 Jan. 6 \u2013 Charles David Busby, 32, was fatally shot in the 7500 block Bellingrath Road.

(Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) The Tribune traces the journey of a .40-caliber Glock handgun used in at least five gang-related shootings in less than a year. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) The young woman arrived home to find a footprint still visible on her front door. Her South Shore apartment had been broken into, and the small safe she kept under her bed was missing, along with the black .40-caliber Glock handgun she kept inside. Over the next year, that Glock would fire 42 bullets, leaving shell casings scattered on walkways, porches and side streets. In the hands of a Sreett gang, the gun was used in at least five separate shootings that left two dead and five others wounded, police say. Officers found the weapon \u2014 loaded with 21 rounds and hidden in a Nike shoebox \u2014 during a routine check in 2015 at a parolee's South Side home, just blocks from where it had been stolen. An extended magazine had been added for firepower and a laser sight for accuracy. Armando L.

A Glock used in five shootings that killed two people sits at the Homan Square police facility June 9, 2016, in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) The story of the Glock's journey from safe to shoebox comes at a tumultuous time for Chicago as homicides spike to levels unseen in the city for two decades. Chicago police say the proliferation of guns plays a key role in the seemingly endless cycle of violence, particularly in impoverished pockets of the South and West sides. As police battle the glut of firearms, the Glock illustrates the devastation \u2014 both human and financial \u2014 that a single gun can leave behind. The Tribune spent several months retracing the gun's movements, visiting each shooting scene, talking to residents who two years later still remember the gunfire that interrupted their lives, speaking to the only victim willing to talk. The Glock was what police call a gang gun, passed among its members as needed. Its devastation \u2014 unusual for one firearm in a year's time \u2014 was spread over a significant stretch of the South Side. \"I've seen five young men lose their lives on this block,\" longtime resident Randolph Strahan said from his front yard in the 2700 block of East 76th Street, just steps from a neighbor's porch where a father of two was killed in the first shooting linked to the Glock by ballistics evidence. \"What's it like to live here?\" the retiree asked rhetorically when a reporter inquired about the block. His soft voice was nearly drowned out by the whistle of a Metra train passing nearby. \"Where are you from?\" he asked. \"You don't know what it's like to be numb.\" Armando L.

Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) A gang's lifeblood With three months still to go in 2016, Chicago has already topped 530 homicides and 3,250 shootings, far more than in all of 2015. On so many levels, the cost of the runaway violence can be immeasurable. It has struck a blow to the city's psyche and national image and taken an emotional toll on survivors, the families of those killed and the larger community. Even the financial costs can be hard to fully tabulate. Taxpayers are sure to foot the bill for much of the hospital care for the thousands shot as well as the cost of law enforcement, including nearly 1,000 police officers being added to the department over the next two years. Just the public cost to investigate this one Glock's five shootings has been considerable. About 50 Chicago police officers responded to the shooting scenes, including technicians who checked for evidence and beat officers who guarded perimeters and talked to victims. Over the last decade, guns have accounted for a growing percentage of the city's homicides, a recent study by Lurie Children's Hospital found. In 2015, nearly nine out of every 10 homicides in Chicago involved guns, up 13 percentage points from just 10 years earlier, according to the study. Two factors make Chicago's gun violence distinct from other big cities \u2014 the strength and size of its Sreett gangs as well as the easy access to firearms in neighboring states because of weak gun laws, said Philip Cook, professor of public policy at Duke University. \"Chicago ends up being surrounded by lax jurisdictions, and that makes it difficult to really control gun availability within the city,\" said Cook, who has studied Chicago's gun violence for years and written on the issue. \"That combined with the high violence rate (driven by gangs) \u2026 is the combination that is the killer, quite literally.\" Guns get to Chicago in many ways. In so-called straw purchases, those with a firearm owner's identification card can carve out a niche business buying guns in Illinois for felons barred from owning weapons because of their criminal records. Another option lies a few miles away over the border in Indiana, where gun shows require no background checks. A study in 2015 by the University of Chicago Crime Lab found 60 percent of the newer guns recovered from gang members had come from out of state \u2014 half of those from Indiana. In separate interviews done at Cook County Jail, gun offenders said gangs sometimes tapped members to make buying trips. \"All they need is one person who got a gun card in the 'hood and everybody got (a gun),\" the study quoted one inmate as saying. The Glock, though, was stolen on Jan. 17, 2014, from an apartment in the 1900 block of East 79th Street just four months after the owner purchased it legally at a Hoffman Estates Cabela's, the outdoor recreation chain. Nearly a year later, authorities recovered the gun only two blocks from where it had been stolen. The Glock was test-fired in the Police Department's forensics firearms unit and linked to 42 of the shell casings recovered at the five shootings, according to Anthony Riccio, chief of the Organized Crime Bureau. Gunmen had fired more than one weapon in two of the shootings. Police officials and gang experts said the gun would have been a hot commodity on the Sreett because it was new and of much higher quality than so many of the 7,000 illegal guns seized in Chicago in 2014. According to numerous police records and interviews with researchers and Chicago police gang intelligence experts, the Glock appears to have been passed among members of the same gang. John J.

Drequan Archie was fatally shot, and another male was wounded. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Guns are the lifeblood of gangs, prized possessions often kept hidden away until needed, then handed out to any number of members who might be tapped to carry out a shooting, according to Riccio. Sometimes guns \"are kept under porches, kept in houses, hidden in traps in cars,\" he said. \"\u2026 They decide amongst themselves whose turn it is to pull the trigger, quite frankly.\" The shootings connected to the Glock hint at the epidemic of violence among gangs and the dilemma facing police. Three of the five victims who survived are themselves now locked up in Cook County Jail on unrelated charges. Many of the shooting victims were affiliated with the same gang and provided scant, if any, detail about who shot them, according to police and Court records. None of the shootings has been solved. 'Why I carry this banger' The trail of violence started on a porch in the 2700 block of East 76th Street on April 11, 2014, three months after and about a mile from where the Glock had been stolen. If you stretch your head up and gaze east from the porch's steps, you can see a bright blue stretch of Lake Michigan, just a few blocks away at Rainbow Beach. On the North Side, this would be prime real estate, but on this block, longtime residents say violence ebbs and flows. Strahan, 68, a retired electrician, said the violence was incessant a few years back when a gang controlled a corner store on the east end of the block. Two of those killings took Place right across from his home, while three others died down the block, he said. \"This has been going on and escalating ever since my son was born 36 years ago. He is out of state. He got away. I am so glad he did,\" he said. On a recent warm evening, with the only noise coming from cicadas, he walked through his yard, pointing to bullet holes on the house next door and on his own brick home amid its blooming flowers in the front and a garden of tomatoes, beans, corn and cucumbers along the side. Strahan attributed most of the violence to gangs fighting over drug dealing. What led to the fatal shooting of Shannon Mack, a father of two, just a couple of doors down from Strahan's home remains uncertain, but during his autopsy, medical examiners found five plastic baggies containing a white powdery substance in Mack's mouth. Strahan said he had noticed earlier that night that a large group had gathered at the neighbor's house, hanging out on the porch. But Mack was alone on the front steps at 9:30 p.m. when someone approached and opened fire. To understand Chicago's violence, start at Kostner Avenue and Monroe Street and walk west up a one-way stretch of graystones and brick two-flats. There on a boarded-up front door you'll see the red stain of gang graffiti. On the cracked sidewalk below lies an empty heroin baggie. Hardened young... The crew of Fire Department Engine 126 found Mack unconscious, leaning against a porch railing. He was shot four times and pronounced dead at the scene. Four spent shell casings were recovered. At 34, Mack was the oldest of the Glock's seven victims. Court records show he had one felony drug conviction in 2003 and was sentenced to two years in prison for possessing a .380-caliber handgun in 2011. At the time of that arrest, he told officers he was carrying the gun for protection after someone he knew had been shot. \"These n------ out here are crazy. That's why I carry this banger,\" he said, according to the police report. Mack's former wife, Tanya Grant, with whom he had two sons, said he held much promise. He was smart and enjoyed writing rhyme and rap. But she wondered if like so many raised in Chicago's most troubled neighborhoods, he didn't have the resources to overcome the negative influences, opting instead to be the \"tough dude\" necessary to survive the mean streets. \"We don't have the answer,\" Grant said of what led to Mack's killing. \"It's a lot of pain in our communities. It's something that most people from the outside, they can't relate to. \u2026 Even though you try to cope and you try to heal the wound, you can't.\" 'Whatever God brings' Violence has become routine around 66th and State streets, but Ammar Awadh, the co-owner of a Citgo gas station at the corner just off the Dan Ryan Expressway, doesn't remember the shooting involving the Glock, the second one linked to the gun. According to police reports, a dark car pulled up beside another vehicle at the intersection about 12:45 a.m. Aug. 25, 2014. Someone in the dark car opened fire at the other vehicle. Two men in their early 20s were shot, one in the groin, the other in the thigh. The dark car fled north on State, and the victims drove themselves to the hospital. Both survived, police said. A dozen .40-caliber shell casings were recovered near the gas station. Another shooting in July of this year \u2014 not linked to the Glock \u2014 left a clerk at the station dead. When somebody put a gun on you, what you say? Nothing. Whatever God brings, welcome it. \u2014 Ammar Awadh Operating a business in this environment comes at a cost. Awadh said he has spent $10,000 on bulletproof glass protecting the cashier, $7,000 on surveillance cameras and $2,600 for added lighting. The business owner also has honed his Sreett smarts \u2014 constantly reading customers to figure out if any pose a threat. \"Use your mind,\" he said of his strategy as he sat recently on a milk crate, the constant din of customers muffled behind the protective glass. \"Don't use your power.\" The shooting of his friend and co-worker has taken an emotional toll on Awadh, leading him to rely more heavily on his Muslim faith, he said. \"When somebody put a gun on you, what you say? Nothing,\" he said. \"Whatever God brings, welcome it.\" 'Help me, help me' The Glock's fourth victim, John Williams, insisted he had no idea why anyone would want to kill him. In a recent interview at Cook County Jail, where he is awaiting trial on an armed robbery charge, he acknowledged his lifestyle courted trouble, hanging out on the Sreett too much. He had been shot once before, in December 2013, Williams said, but he denied being a gang member. Williams was on his way home from a friend's house on Oct. 25, 2014, when a car raced up behind his 2005 silver Grand Prix, and several people inside fired a fusillade of shots in the 2700 block of East 81st Street. As glass shattered, the 22-year-old grabbed his neck because of the stinging pain. He drove about a block before fleeing the car for help. \"It really don't matter who did it. I just want to know why. Why would anybody shoot me?\" Williams asked. \"I don't recall (doing anything) that would make anybody want to kill me.\" Police collected 38 shell casings at the scene. Thirteen had been fired from the Glock, while the rest came from two other guns used in the shooting. A woman who lived nearby came to Williams' aid, handing him a towel to try to stop the bleeding. \"He kept saying, 'Help me, help me,'\" said the neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of fear for her safety. \"He was crying. He said, 'I've been shot, I've been shot.'\" At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, doctors removed a bullet from his left arm that was wedged between two bones, leaving a thin seam of a scar running the length of his forearm. A bullet in the back of his neck could not be removed without risking further injury so doctors left it until muscle and tissue nudged it close enough to the surface of his skin. Doctors removed the bullet a month later, he said.

On Sunday, January 12, 2014, two Alabama hunters lost their lives in separate and unrelated hunting accidents in entirely different geographical areas of the state. The first victim lost his life in Tallapoosa County, while the second befell tragedy in Blount County. Both tragic accidents could have been avoided had greater safety precautions been taken. AL.com shared the stories. The first fatal accident took Place early in the morning, just after 6:30 a.m. near Tallapoosa's Lake Martin. The victim was a hunter named James Raymond Landers, a 50-year old man who was hunting a property - supposedly a public slab of land - with a bow. Unbeknownst to Landers, a second hunter was already scanning the property from atop a tree stand, with a gun in hand. The second hunter must have mistaken Landers for a deer or some other type of game animal, because when he saw movement in the woods, he took aim and fired. The premature shot proved fatal, leaving Landers dead and igniting a police investigation in the area. So far, the shooting has been ruled an accident and blame has not been laid upon the other hunter. Precisely what the second hunter believed he was shooting at has not yet been clarified in the news. However, reports indicate that Landers wasn't wearing orange reflective gear and therefore could have reasonably been mistaken as a game animal. Still, the second hunter should not have fired until he knew what he was shooting at. Mistakes were made on both sides of the gun barrel, and both of them call for greater vigilance in hunting safety for all. The police investigator in the Tallapoosa case stated that the investigation was ongoing, but that he couldn't recall more than maybe a single other hunting fatality occurring in his jurisdiction. However, while hunting fatalities may be rare, they sometimes coincide in bizarre fashion, and that's precisely what happened in the state of Alabama last weekend. As Landers was being mourned in Tallapoosa County on Sunday evening, another hunter was felled in Blount County - roughly two and a half miles away by car. The Blount fatality struck Adam Scott Jordan, a 37-year old hunter who, unlike James Raymond Landers, had not been hunting alone on Sunday. Realted story: What Happens When An Alabama Deer Visits A Thrift Store? [VIDEO] On the contrary, reports indicate that Jordan was hunting with two other friends when he was injured and killed. Reports say one of the other people he was hunting with accidentally discharged their weapon, and Jordan was on the receiving end of the blast. Much like with the Tallapoosa fatality, police reports stated that neither Jordan nor his hunting buddies had been wearing orange reflective clothing. Whether that piece of the story relates in any way to how Jordan was shot, however, is still a bit unclear. In many places around the country, hunting accidents have actually been on the decline in recent years, but as these two twin Alabama shootings prove, there is still a great need for hunting safety classes and for other rules, regulations, and behaviors that can promote safe procedures among the hunting community. Wearing orange blaze is obviously a big safeguard that hunters can have to make sure they don't end up being mistaken for a game animal. However, trigger happy hunters also need to be more careful - and to be held more accountable - for stray shots that result in serious injuries and lost lives.", "publish_date": "2014-01-18"}, {"text": "He is also facing one gross misdemeanor charge of fifth-degree drug possession stemming from Tuesday's arrest. Synowczynski had been scheduled to appear in Court Wednesday for a settlement conference on charges of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon and fourth-degree assault of a peace officer filed after an armed standoff with law enforcement in July 2017. According to Court documents filed Wednesday in Swift County District Court, law enforcement, including the West Central SWAT team, were called at 12:24 p.m. Tuesday to a residence on the 200 block of East Snelling Avenue in Appleton. The caller, who was identified in Court documents as Synowczynski's wife, told law enforcement he had a pipe and a bullet and was threatening both law enforcement and herself. When law enforcement arrived on scene, officers learned Synowczynski was in a fish house parked in the backyard, while the rest of the family was in the house, documents said. The family was evacuated. Synowczynski had an improvised 12-gauge zip gun that was handmade from a steel pipe with a 12-gauge round, Court documents said. A shotgun also was reported missing from the family's basement. Law enforcement learned Synowczynski had been taking drugs and alcohol during the past couple of weeks and that his wife had recently asked for a divorce, Court documents state. Synowczynski had moved out into the fish house last week and had been saying he was going to kill himself. At one point Tuesday, Synowczynski had been in the family home, but a family member locked the door behind him when he left. When Synowczynski returned to the door, he had the steel pipe and bullet and told his wife that she was going to die today. Members of the SWAT team tried to talk with Synowcyznski while he was in the fish house. The documents said Synowcyznski continued to yell at law enforcement, saying they were going to die, at one point brandishing the improvised 12-gauge zip gun out the window. The SWAT team shot canisters of pepper spray into the fish house, but Synowcyznski refused to come out, even though he could be heard coughing inside the fish house. After negotiations continued to fail and Synowcyznski would not exit the fish house, a skid loader was used to break through the front of the fish house. Synowcyznski continued to refuse law enforcement orders to come out. A SWAT officer used a stun gun on Synowcyznski through one of the fish house windows and he was taken into custody, the Court documents said. On Synowcyznski's person, the improvised 12-gauge zip gun was found and the 12-gauge slug was found to be live. A search warrant that was executed at Synowcyznski's house and fish house found additional ammunition and a firearm. Also found in the fish house was a small white plastic file with white residue on it. This residue field tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine. Synowcyznski was medically cleared from the hospital and transported to jail. A preliminary breath test found Synowcyznki's blood-alcohol level to be at 0.20, Court documents said. Also filed in Court Wednesday was an application for a warrant for Synowczynski's arrest for violating the terms of his release for the July 2017 overnight standoff. Conditions on his release included not possessing or consuming alcohol or mood-altering drugs not prescribed by a physician and not possessing firearms or ammunition. According to the criminal complaint in that July case, Synowczynski apparently fled from a drunken driving breath test, assaulted the pursuing officer and then barricaded himself in his home for several hours. Late in the standoff he was seen pointing a long gun at officers, according to the complaint. SWAT gained entrance to the house and took Synowczynski into custody after he fell while coming down the stairs, pointing a shotgun at officers. The gun was later found to be loaded. Synowczynski's next Court appearance for both cases is scheduled for March 16.", "publish_date": "2018-02-28"}, {"text": "Another round of snow is headed for the region , but the snowy winter has not put home invasions on ice.

Chase Kramer, 21, was arrested on preliminary charges of aggravated battery with a firearm, battery with a deadly weapon, intimidation with a deadly weapon and attempted murder with a firearm. Evansville Police Department officers were dispatched Friday to the 1800 block of Stevens Avenue for a person with a gun. It was reported that Kramer had a gun to his girlfriend's head. When officers arrived on scene two subjects left the home and said Kramer was inside threatening to kill his girlfriend. The girlfriend eventually exited the house, followed shortly by Kramer who surrendered himself to police. All four subjects were taken to EPD headquarters to speak with detectives. According to the affidavit, Kramer told a detective during questioning that he, his girlfriend and a friend were all driving when they went back to his house and he retrieved his gun. After he got back in the car and they began heading toward the 1800 block of Stevens, Kramer put the gun up to his girlfriend's head and pulled the trigger. He told the detective the gun was not loaded. The girlfriend told detectives she did not think much when Kramer initially grabbed the gun since he always has it with him. She said he racked the slide back and had one round in his hand when he put the gun to her head. She said he also grabbed her face and screamed at her when they were inside the house on Stevens. The affidavit states Kramer told his girlfriend he was going to kill her and then kill himself. He said he was upset and the two had been arguing for a few days. The passenger in the backseat told detectives he was scared and could tell Kramer was both intoxicated and angry. The passenger said Kramer put the gun to his girlfriend's multiple times and pulled the trigger saying he would kill her and everyone around. According to the affidavit, Kramer told the passenger he would kill as many officers as he could until he died if they were to arrive on scene. Kramer's initial hearing is set for Wednesday.

At least two armored police vehicles responded to the South LA neighborhood and nearby streets were closed during the standoff. \"Officers approached the residence, the suspect exited the location with a possible firearm. At this point, the officer requested SWAT; SWAT responded, suspect then again does the same thing -- exits the residence with what appears to be a firearm and an officer-involved shooting occurs,\" said Sgt. Frank Preciado, with LAPD.

One of the teenagers sexually assaulted the woman inside. Brandon Hemingway, 17, will spend 17 years in prison for the sexual assault and his part in the Jan. 26, 2014 burglary on Hartson Avenue. Jan Valerio, who was 15 at the time, will spend 3 1/3 to 10 years in custody for the burglary. Due to his age, he will be held in a juvenile facility, not state prison, said his lawyer Jeffrey DeRoberts. Both teens are accused of targeting the Hartson Avenue residence, breaking in and stealing items while threatening the middle-aged couple inside with a sawed-off shotgun and a revolver, said Assistant District Attorney Anthony Germano. Hemingway then forced the woman into sexual acts in the bedroom, which were witnessed by her longtime partner, Germano said. Nothing was taken from the residence. Police tracked down Hemingway because his DNA was on the bed, Germano said. Hemingway then admitted to the burglary and sexual assault and implicated Valerio. Germano said Hemingway's statements were the only thing tying Valerio to the crime. (The victims knew two people were involved, but both burglars were wearing masks.) Hemingway pleaded guilty in early December in exchange for a 17-year prison sentence. Germano said he agreed to the plea deal because Hemingway was prepared to testify against Valerio. (The maximum Hemingway could have faced was 25 years in prison.) A week later, Valerio pleaded guilty. The sex assault victim died in late December from cancer, Germano said. But the prosecutor said he did have the opportunity to tell her that both of the burglars had pleaded guilty. Germano said the victim wanted the teenagers to be punished, but was not vindictive toward them. Both teens were sentenced this month, with Valerio's sentencing today. Before sentencing, County Court Judge Joseph Fahey called the burglary and sex assault \"one of the most ugly, vicious encounters I've seen in my time in court.\" Due to his young age, Valerio was sentenced to the maximum punishment under law, 3 1/3 to 10 years in a juvenile facility, Germano said. Valerio was also sentenced on an unrelated drug charge that will not add additional time behind bars. Germano said he agreed with the judge's assessment of the case, and said he hopes Valerio serves all 10 years in custody.", "publish_date": "2015-01-27"}, {"text": "Parents, students sent into panic after shots fired at parked car near bus stop Copyright by WKRN - All rights reserved (Photo: WKRN) [ + - ] Video There are multiple videos in this story.

(Photo: Chris LaChall/Staff Photographer)Buy Photo EDGEWATER PARK - A school crossing guard shot his wife before killing himself early Wednesday morning, Burlington County law enforcement officials said. County Prosecutor Scott Coffina and Edgewater Park Police Chief Gene Di Filippo said officers were called to the 200 block of Roosevelt Avenue just after 1 a.m. and found Michelle Moses-Martin, 46, outside with multiple gunshot wounds to her chest. They said her husband, 57-year-old Gregory Martin, emerged briefly onto the front porch of the home before going back inside. About two hours later, members of the New Jersey State Police Technical Emergency and Mission Specialists Unit entered the house and found Martin had committed suicide with a firearm, officials said. Moses-Martin survived the shooting and was taken to Cooper University Hospital in Camden, where she was listed in critical but stable condition after surgery, officials said. Coffina said Martin was a retired New Jersey Department of Corrections employee and currently was employed by the township a school crossing guard for the Mildred Magowan Elementary School a few blocks from his home. The prosecutor said the motive for the shooting is under investigation and that some early news reports of a standoff at the house were inaccurate. Joel Bewley, the prosecutor's office spokesman, said Moses-Martin ran to the home next door after she was shot and knocked on the door for help. That neighbor called for help. Another neighbor, Jennifer James, who lives across the Sreett said her husband woke her up after hearing gunshots around 1 a.m. James said she was not well acquainted with the Martins, who had moved to the neighborhood two years ago, only exchanging pleasantries when they saw one another on the dead-end Sreett abutting a park. \"We don't know what happened with the man. It never seemed to us anything was wrong,\" James said. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to Mrs. Martin and we would be on the lookout for any student concerns (about the crossing guard) and offer any needed support,\u201d said township school superintendent Roy Rakszawski. Wednesday's incident is the second shooting in the township this year. On Jan. 12 David Dibraccio, 26, formerly of Vineland, was shot to death at Edgewater Manor Apartments following a fight with two other men. \u201cAlthough these incidents are disturbing and even scary to realize that they happen so close to our homes, I want to remind everyone not to be quick to judge our township's overall public safety based on these events,\u201d Di Filippo said. The shootings were not random acts of violence, the chief, and both involved people who knew each other. \u201cNo town can prevent or predict acts of violence committed by one person toward another that they have some type of friendship or other relationship, whether it be acts of domestic violence as in the case of the incident that occurred last night, or acts of violence involving subjects who are familiar with each other and become involved in heated arguments.\" The chief also praised first responders and officers for quickly treating and stabilizing the victim before emergency medical services took her to the hospital.

State and federal investigators went to Maximilien R. Reynolds' apartment in Ithaca, New York, on March 7 after a Walmart employee reported his purchase of gun ammunition, hacksaw blades and other tools as suspicious, according to an affidavit filed Thursday by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Reynolds, 19, is on a leave of absence from Cornell and was taking classes at Tompkins-Cortland Community College when the ATF, the FBI and New York State Police went to his apartment to look for possible explosives, investigators said. His girlfriend was home, let them inside and said she was concerned about Reynolds, according to the affidavit. He seemed \"manic,\" was not taking his medications and was getting little sleep, she told investigators. The apartment was in \"severe disarray,\" with piles of clothes, food and lab glassware strewn about and mathematical equations scrawled on a window in red ink, authorities said. They said a bullet-resistant vest, military-style clothing and tactical items were also visible in the apartment. Investigators went back to the apartment later when Reynolds was home, they said, and he consented to having his rifle and other weapons confiscated. He agreed to go to Cayuga Medical Center for a psychiatric evaluation, authorities said. Authorities said they also found the following items in Reynolds' apartment: A homemade bomb made out of consumer fireworks and other materials 300 rounds of ammunition in magazine clips compatible with the AR-15 Two sets of ballistic body armor A gas mask A pipe Chemicals typically used to make explosives Ball bearings that could be used as shrapnel in a bomb Additional bomb-making materials were found in two storage units being rented by Reynolds, investigators said. Another Ithaca resident told authorities that last fall, Reynolds gave him $1,000 to buy a firearm and another $200 to complete the transaction. Reynolds told the other man that he had to purchase the gun because Reynolds was prohibited from buying it himself, the affidavit says. The man falsely certified when he bought the firearm that he was its true owner, investigators said. Reynolds is charged with two counts of possession of an unregistered destructive device/silencer, one count of false statement in acquisition of a firearm and one count of false statement in required firearm record. Reynolds' Ithaca-based attorney, Ray Schlather, said his client is ill and was undergoing behavioral health treatment at Cayuga Medical Center when the FBI arrested him late Thursday night. A federal judge has directed that his treatment continue and his mental health be evaluated before Court proceedings move forward, so Reynolds has not entered a plea, Schlather said. \"All preliminary indications are that the materials and conduct at issue were defensive in nature, arising out of his medical condition, and that no one was under threat or in jeopardy,\" Schlather said in an email. Ithaca police in June 2016 had detained Reynolds under the New York Mental Hygiene Law, the affidavit says. Reynolds' mother lives in New Jersey, the complaint says, and public records show a Maximilien Reynolds with an address of Rumson in Monmouth County. A call to the Reynolds family's home Saturday was not immediately returned. Cornell said in a statement that its campus police department was cooperating with local and federal authorities and believed there was no threat to the school or surrounding areas. \"The arrest was made following a tip from a good Samaritan in the local community,\" Cornell's vice president for university relations, Joel Malina, said in a statement. \"This is a good reminder that we can all help to keep our community safe by immediately reporting suspicious activity.\" Marisa Iati may be reached at miati@njadvancemedia.com.

UW-Milwaukee Police tell FOX6 News they got a call around 4:00 a.m. from a student who said he came back to his dorm room in the South Tower of Sandburg Hall and found a gun that wasn't his on his bed. UW-Milwaukee Police say they went to the student's room and discovered the gun, which they say was stolen. Police say they also discovered electronics in the room that the student said did not belong to him, or to his roommates. Police looked at security cameras and discovered suspects getting into Sandburg Hall's North Tower elevator. Sandburg North was then placed on lockdown -- and police began searching room by room, floor by floor. Three individuals were taken into custody on one of the highest floors of the building. They include two students/residents of Sandburg Hall, and one non-student/non-resident, according to police. Police say they believe the suspects were able to steal items from about 15-20 dorm rooms. Police say that because a lot of the students at UW-Milwaukee are not on campus on the weekends, they do not necessarily know to whom the stolen items belong. FOX6 News spoke with a woman who says her cell phone was taken after someone walked into her unlocked room. \"My stuff was gone -- just my phone. That's unsettling. It's kinda creepy. We just need to lock our doors -- make sure they're locked. We're getting our stuff back and taking better precautions,\" UWM sophomore Molly Wiese said. UWM freshman Mauri Dismukes says she saw two of the three accused burglars get arrested by police at gunpoint. He believes the suspects in this case were going from room to unlocked room - stealing if no one was around.

The call initially came in about 3:30 p.m. as a report of a suicide, said JPSO spokesman Lt. Jason Rivarde. At the scene in the 4800 block of Loveland Street, responding deputies found Chad McAvoy's mother, 42-year-old Connie McAvoy, lying in the hallway of her home, with a single gunshot wound. The woman's death was initially investigated as a suicide, but it was determined to be a homicide as the investigation progressed, Rivarde said. Evidence at the scene was not indicative of a suicide, Jefferson Parish interim Sheriff Joe Lopinto said late Thursday. \"Both the father and the son were here on the scene, claimed that it was a suicide at the time, or an apparent suicide,\" Lopinto said. Both Chad McAvoy and his father were taken into custody and questioned. During questioning, Chad McAvoy admitted that he had killed his mother, Lopinto said. As of late Thursday, Chad McAvoy father -- the victim's husband -- did not face charges in the shooting, Lopinto said, but he did not rule out future charges. At the scene Thursday night, several neighbors said they often heard arguing at the house where all three McAvoys lived. One neighbor said when he arrived home from work about 3:30 or 3:45 Thursday afternoon to find investigators filling the 4800 block of Loveland, he had just one question for law enforcement: \"Is she dead?\" \"I knew when I saw the cops,\" he said. Shortly afterward, he said he saw emergency responders enter the home with a gurney and then exit with the gurney still empty. Later, coroner's office workers appeared instead at the home, he said. Neighbors remembered Connie McAvoy as someone who relished gardening, her hobby evident by the carefully manicured front yard. \"She was always taking care of the garden,\" a neighbor said. Lopinto declined to comment on a possible motive for the killing, citing the ongoing investigation. As word of Chad McAvoy's arrest began appearing on news sites Thursday night, neighbors who had gathered in driveways and huddled on the sidewalk across from the McAvoys' home seemed stunned. \"Holy sh--, holy crap,\" one woman said repeatedly. \"Really, its shocking,\" another neighbor said, adding that neighbors were horrified at the news. \"Devastated and saddened.\" Correction: An earlier version of this post included an incorrect spelling of the McAvoys' surname, based on information provided by JPSO.

Most evenings, the 56-year-old and his wife walked to a neighborhood store to play Keno, which is what they were doing moments before Foster was gunned down Thursday outside his Irvington home in Southwest Baltimore. Marcia Simpson-Foster, who said her husband didn't have any trouble with anyone, believes it must have been a case of mistaken identity. \"I can't imagine why someone would do this to my husband,\" Simpson-Foster, 53, said through tears. \"This is the worst thing.\" The shooting continued a blistering pace of violence in Baltimore. Foster was one of five people shot Thursday, and on Friday morning, a 52-year-old woman was found dead inside her home overlooking Patterson Park in Highlandtown in what police were investigating as a burglary gone wrong. The killings swelled the city's number of homicides in January to 27, equaling the number killed last June when the city was besieged by a wave of shootings. January is typically a quieter month, with an average of 13 slain over the past four years. Simpson-Foster said her husband was well-liked on his street, shoveling snow or helping with back-to-school events. He had no criminal record. When they arrived home from their trip to the store, the 4200 block of Walrad Street was still. Simpson-Foster walked into the house to the kitchen, and her 32-year-old son asked Foster to start his car for him. Foster obliged and went back outside. Simpson-Foster said she didn't hear a sound, but suddenly her son yelled for her to call 911. Her son and a neighbor urged her not to look outside. \"All I could see was my husband laying in the middle of the street,\" she said. A car could be seen driving off down the street, she said. Police haven't released any information on suspects or a motive. Simpson-Foster said that her neighborhood has seen some incidents over the years, but she has not feared violence against her family. \"This city \u2026\" she said. \"I don't know what needs to be done. But something needs to be done.\" For the first time in at least a decade, Foster will not help set up the Great Chesapeake Bay Swim, an annual charitable fundraiser for the Maryland chapter of the March of Dimes, where Foster has been a longtime volunteer. \"It's a devastating blow to me, to our staff, to everyone at the March of Dimes,\" race director Chuck Nabit said. \"He was such a wonderful, dedicated and tirelessly hardworking volunteer. A really exceptional human being.\" Foster was one of just a handful people who set up and broke down event banners and tables and provided food for athletes at the race's starting point and finish line, Nabit said. Over the course of the race weekend in June, he put in between 25 and 30 hours of his own time on the Eastern Shore. \"He just had a big heart,\" said Nabit, calling the loss \"senseless.\" \"He was a very giving individual.\" Within the Central Maryland division of the March of Dimes, Foster had been a do-everything leader for more than 25 years. \"He is our No. 1 guy when it comes to anything logistics driven,\" said Jennifer Tarr, a March of Dimes division director who spoke with him just a week ago to begin planning for the March for Babies event in the spring. \"There is no job too big or too small for him.\" In Highlandtown, the unidentified victim died in a rowhouse in the 400 block of S. Ellwood Avenue Behind crime scene tape in the rear of the home, a chair from an outdoor furniture set was pushed below the kitchen window, which was open. Police did not provide additional details, but a neighbor who did not want to be identified said investigators told her they believed it was a burglary. From the front of the home, nothing appeared out of the ordinary except for two marked police SUVs parked on the street. \"This is unusual for this block,\" said neighbor Greg Atkins. \"Trust me, my eyes are open all the time.\" A police spokesman said officers discovered the woman's body about 7:30 a.m. after receiving a 911 call from someone reporting an unconscious person. The woman had suffered trauma to the body, police said, declining to specify. City Council member James B. Kraft, who represents Highlandtown, said he requested additional officers, including on foot patrol, in the neighborhood before Christmas and again this year. He said the mayor's administration and police commanders told him the department is too understaffed to fulfill the requests. \"I don't have a gun. I don't have a badge,\" he said. \"I can't stand on every corner.

A husband and wife were making repairs to the business on the corner of 6th Avenue and Northwest 29th Street when all of a sudden there was a commotion on the sidewalk. Shots were fired, hitting one man in the leg and another on the side, police said. The business owner's wife, Dieneyis Padron was standing between two cars when she heard five shots. Her husband and his cousin had been hit. Inside Miami's Crime History \"I thought, 'I'm going to die,'\" she said.

The student at Seven Lakes High School was in custody on Monday. His identity has not been released. The weapon that prompted the evacuation turned out to be a homemade firearm, school officials said. They initially thought it could have been an explosive device and a law enforcement bomb squad was called to the school in the 9200 block of South Fry. A school staffer was told about a \"security threat\" - which led to the evacuation - after a regularly scheduled fire drill at 10:05 a.m. that had already sent more than 3,000 students out of the building, officials said. The suspicious object was in the east section of the sprawling campus. \"The assistant principal said, 'This doesn't look right,' \" said Steve Stanford, a Katy ISD spokesman. When the students were moved the second time, they were directed to an area near the campus baseball and football fields. \"We thought it was just another drill. We didn't think much of it,\" said Sanjana Madakshire, 17, a senior. Students spent several hours waiting to either return to school or be released. Madakshire said any information the students received came through word-of-mouth or their smart phones. \"They didn't tell us anything. I don't think they were sure of what to do,\" she said. With the campus sealed off, police from several agencies, including FBI bomb squad agents, began sweeping the building and checking the suspicious device. By 4 p.m., the campus was cleared of any danger. The device turned out to be a kind of firearm known as a zip gun. Such a weapon can be as crude as a pipe with a block of wood for a handle and a rubber band providing the power for a firing pin. \"They are things that are illegal - especially on a school campus,\" Stanford said. A rifle also was found in the trunk of the student's car in the school's parking lot, officials said.
