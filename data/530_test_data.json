'Last year was a historically bad year for the Congressional budget process,' said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, noting it was the first time since 1976 that neither the House nor the Senate voted on a budget resolution. 'Unfortunately, this only adds to a poor budget record,' the group added. One important point before we get too deep into Legislative Nerd Territory - the term 'budget' does not relate to actual spending, but rather to what's known as the 'budget resolution,' which is a budget outline - a framework - for what Congress will do later in the year, filling in the blanks with the specifics of spending choices. As the CFRB notes, this year is not getting off to a good start on the budget, which is even more troublesome given the divided nature of Congress, with Democrats in charge of the House, and Republicans leading the Senate. And the forecast is for a difficult budget year - which many believe might end up in another government shutdown in October, and a possible across-the-board sequester soon after. Here's just some of what gone on, and what to look for on Capitol Hill. 1. Divided House Democrats punt on 2020 budget. Just like Republicans in the House struggled for years to balance the interests of more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus and more moderate GOP lawmakers, Democrats have the same balancing act. More liberal members want to do big things in the budget. More moderate 'Blue Dog' Democrats want a more middle ground on spending. And so, Democrats had to give up plans last week to vote on a bill to raise the caps on federal spending for the next two years by nearly $350 billion. Progressives didn't like it because it spent too much on defense, at $733 billion. Meanwhile, some more moderate Democrats were talking about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The internal Democratic Party dustup was music to ears of Republicans, who chortled about the Democrats running into the Legislative Ditch. 2. Senate Republicans didn't vote on their budget outline either. While Republicans chuckled at the failure of Democrats to force a vote on their budget plan for 2020, GOP Senators didn't even try to act on their budget resolution before the April 15 deadline. The Senate GOP budget resolution would reduce future planned spending increases by over a half billion dollars, but it wouldn't come close to the defense spending levels backed by President Trump - who wants $750 billion for defense. House Democrats have proposed $733 billion, while the Senate Republican budget would have funding for the military set at $643 billion, well below the President's request. And so, for a second straight year, there was no budget vote-a-rama in the Senate on the non-binding budget resolution. 3. The Defense Budget Gimmick used by both parties. With budget caps in place that limit how much you can spend on the military and non-defense items in the budget, Congress is still doing its best to get around those limits, especially for the military, by using an extra fund known as OCO - which stands for Overseas Contingency Operations. For example, President Trump's 2020 budget would put $174 billion in the OCO fund - more money than almost all other federal agencies - in order to get to a $750 billion budget for the Pentagon. Democrats have $69 billion in OCO, with Senate Republicans at $67 billion. If there's no deal on raising the budget caps, then the most money which could be spent on the Pentagon is $576 billion - unless, you get around that with the OCO $174 billion. 'OCO would be the 2nd largest federal agency, if it was an agency,' grumbled the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, as many say it's nothing but a slush fund. 4. McConnell, Pelosi want to negotiate a new budget deal. Even as Democrats were running aground on their effort to pass a bill which increases the spending caps, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to start talks on a budget agreement, as both parties know full well they need to get going now in order to have any chance of an across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. If you look at graphic just above this bullet point, you will see the figure of $576 billion for the Pentagon, and $542 billion for non-defense spending - those are the 'spending caps' set in law by a 2011 bipartisan budget deal. Current funding is much more than that, at $716 billion for the Pentagon and $605 billion for non-defense spending. The last three deals on the budget caps have raised the amount of spending each time - and the President may not go for that this time around. 5. Looming over all of this is a sequester. The reason lawmakers want to reach a 'spending caps' agreement is that the Budget Act of 2011 is still on the books, and if there is no agreement on the amount of money to spend in 2020, then an across-the-board budget cut known as the 'sequester' will kick in. And that would be a very big deal. If a sequester hits, the military budget would technically have go down from $716 billion to $576 billion - a cut of $140 billion. If the sequester kicks in, domestic spending would be trimmed from $605 billion to $542 billion. Ironically, because of the big increase that the GOP Congress was able to give to the Pentagon in 2017 and 2018, a sequester would hurt the military more than non-defense spending in 2020 and beyond. This is where the OCO funding (look above) comes into play - President Trump could allow the sequester to kick in, but still funnel more money to the Pentagon through that extra fund. One problem with that game plan is the GOP probably would not have 60 votes in the Senate to get that done.

The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.\n\n\u201cAfter the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,\u201d said Lt.

The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.\n\nThe memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it\u2019s the parking lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals.

Still, the neighborhood is tired of the violence and wants the bar to close, she said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep affording to have someone injured or murdered in our neighborhood,\u201d Niemchick said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t have that.

Eleven people were injured when gunmen opened fire in front of a crowd outside an apartment building. (The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. police announced on Thursday their first break in Monday\u2019s early morning drive-by shooting on North Capitol Street, posting pictures of two 19-year-olds being sought in connection with the wounding of 13 people outside an apartment building.\n\nLate Thursday night, police announced that they had issued an arrest warrant for Craig Wilson for assault with intent to kill in connection with the mass shooting. Wilson has a revolver tattoo on his neck and is described as 6-foot-2 and weighing 140 pounds, authorities said.\n\nThe statement came hours after police officials identified Wilson and Andrew Davon Allen as people of interest in the case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to locate and interview two people we believe have information on the case,\u201d Cmdr. George Kucik told reporters outside D.C. police headquarters in the afternoon.\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see if anyone knows where they might be.\u201d\n\nKucik had a message for the men: \u201cReach out to us. Come in and talk to us.\u201d\n\nCraig Wilson (Courtesy of D.C. police)\n\nFive hours later, police announced the arrest warrant for Wilson but did not release details or why they considered Wilson a suspect.\n\nPolice also said they had located one of the two vehicles used in the shooting, which occurred about 2:10 a.m. on North Capitol Street, just off New York Avenue in front of an apartment complex called Tyler House.\n\nPolice haven\u2019t found the other vehicle, Kucik said, described as a dark blue or black 1999 Mercedes-Benz CLK 320 coupe with D.C. license plates EF7810. Police have posted a $10,000 reward for anyone with information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nMost of the victims suffered minor wounds to their legs and arms, though one was struck in the lower back and critically injured.\n\nThe number of victims startled a city in which gun violence has been dropping. It occurred at the edge of a neighborhood transitioning into a gentrified district of condos, retail stores and offices. A name given by developers, NoMa, short for north of Massachusetts Avenue, has stuck.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s violence and the fact that several victims, including three sisters, had just emerged from a mega-nightclub ignited old discussions over gentrification. A D.C. Council member proclaimed the area\u2019s clubs, which existed before the latest burst of redevelopment, to be incompatible with the changing area, while a police commander pointed at crime from Tyler House, a subsidized tower of apartments.\n\nPolice have not described a motive, and they said little about the case Thursday. Authorities have indicated that they are looking into whether a dispute at the club precipitated the violence, or whether the incident is tied to long-standing beefs between neighborhood crews from Tyler House and those on the other side of New York Avenue in Truxton Circle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do in this case,\u201d Kucik said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d", "shooting_date": "2013-03-11", "address": "1200 North Capitol Street", "n_killed": 0, "n_injured": 13}, {"incident_id": 482801, "title": "No death penalty in Libby Lake killings", "publish_date": "2014-12-16", "text": "The District Attorney\u2019s Office has announced that it will not seek the death penalty against a group of men charged in the fatal shootings of two teens last year at Libby Lake Park in Oceanside.\n\nMartin Melendrez, 23; Santo Diaz, 20, and Michael Zurita, 21; and Kevin Brizuela, 19, each face two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder in connection with the shootings on March 13, 2013.\n\nThe men also face special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders, which gave prosecutors the option of seeking the executions of three defendants who were adults at the time of the shootings. They now face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.\n\nBecause Brizuela was 17 when the killings occurred, he is not eligible for the death penalty.

Suspect Kurt Myers, of Mohawk, is believed to be hunkered down in a vacant building in downtown Herkimer after shooting at police early Wednesday afternoon.\n\n2. Herkimer and Mohawk schools are closed today and Herkimer County Community College classes are delayed to 10 a.m. due to the standoff, The Utica Observer-Dispatch reported as of 6:30 a.m.\n\n3. State police have identified the victims as:\n\nHarry Montgomery, 68, of 3 S. Washington St., Mohawk and retired corrections officer Michael Ransear, of 114 Delrose Lane, Herkimer. Both customers at a village of Mohawk barber shop were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nTwo others were critically wounded at the barbershop: John Seymour, 66, owner of the barber shop, and Daniel A. Haslauer, 67, customer at the barber shop. Both were listed in critical condition Wednesday at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Utica.\n\nKilled at a car care business in the village of Herkimer were Thomas Stefka, an employee, and Michael L. Renshaw, a customer and 23-year corrections officer.\n\n4. Suspected gunman Myers was described as a loner who rarely talked to neighbors. A victim's family told The Associated Press that he fired at victims without warning.\n\n5. Authorities believe Myers set his apartment house on fire shortly before 9:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, then went to the barbershop where he opened fire. Afterwards, he went to the car care center before bringing downtown Herkimer to a standstill by holing up in the abandoned building Wednesday afternoon.\n\n6. Myers is believed to have fired at officers from inside the abandoned building. That's the last contact authorities had with him.\n\n7. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico spoke to media at 5 p.m. Wednesday in the first few hours of the standoff. Cuomo said it was too early to tell if stricter gun laws, which he has championed, could have prevented Wednesday's mayhem. The governor said the \"day is not done\" until Myers is apprehended.\n\nThe Utica Observer-Dispatch created this map with the locations of events throughout the day:", "shooting_date": "2013-03-13", "address": "17 W Main St", "n_killed": 6, "n_injured": 2}, {"incident_id": 482838, "title": "4 Shot During Drive-By Shooting In West Modesto, California - Modesto News", "publish_date": "", "text": "Published on Mar 14, 2013\n\nThis evening at around 8:00 p.m. officers from the Modesto Police Department along with Emergency Crews were dispatched to Western Way near Sutter Ave. in Modesto, California for reports of a Drive-By Shooting with multiple gunshot victims.\n\n\n\nWhen police arrived they found a total of 4 adult victims, 3 men and 1 woman.

It is awful that young people join gangs and think that they are doing something. Get a real job. Work for a living! Do the things the right way the way our forefathers set this country up. It pisses me off that we have N.Korea threatening our country and we are worried about protecting our territory from lowly, uneducated thugs who actually think people are scared of them because they wear a certain color. Territory and apartments that I wouldn't let my dog live in by the way. Arrest all of these thugs and then get the parents for being negligent and not properly raising their kids.\n\n\n\nPosted: Friday, April 12, 2013\n\nArticle comment by: C. Kirk\n\n\n\nIts funny how everyone wants to blame everyone except the people actually involved. These shootings that have been happening are all gang related. If you're a parent of one of these delinquents then you should know whether or not your child is in a gang. And if you dont then you're not doing your job. If they're living in your house which most of them probably are, then there should be no privacy. if you find guns, drugs or colors in their room then you need to act. if not, you're just as guilty when they pull the trigger or get shot because they were wearing the wrong color or the drug deal goes south. And to all the people that know who is in a gang and dont report them, youre just as guilty. Gangs breed violence and crime. Nothing good comes of them and if you're in one then you're an idiot. If you want power and respect and a sense of pride, join the military, learn a trade. And if you really want to shoot someone then go infantry or marines. Law enforcement cant do it on their own. Ignorance, Fear and silence have a strangle hold on this community and it will ultimately rip us apart.\n\n\n\nPosted: Tuesday, April 9, 2013\n\nArticle comment by: Crystal Hawkins\n\n\n\nFirst, I would like to say SORRY to families that have lost a loved on to this foolishness. I am a single parent of two teenagers (boy and girl). I try my very best to instill positive values that were taught to me by my grandparents, parents and numerous others. But, society today as a whole, has changed altogether. Yes, we say that we need role models and more people getting involved with the lives of theses children and I totally agree. Now, you have some parents that try to be their child's friend rather than raise them. I do believe that there should be a bond between you and your children, but define your boundaries. Don't uphold your children in their wrong doings, chastise them. Make it a priority to read and understand the Bible (ex. GOING TO CHURCH), have a family sit down meal, doing family outings, and pray together. Provide positive results is all that I am saying. Do not let them raise you!!!!! I remember when I was younger, if I even looked like I wanted to step out of line with my parents or grandparents, I would get dealt with then (and it was not a time out or punishment). Now, some of these parents do not want you to say anything to their children. If you do, then you are wrong. So, in my opinion only, this is what the result will be.

Each of the three face 20 years to life in prison when they are sentenced in January.\n\nTheir joint plea deals with prosecutors do not require them to testify against the lone FnD member still facing trial, their older brother, Travis \"Trap\" Scott, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Payne said. Travis Scott is set to go to trial next month as the alleged leader of FnD.\n\nNew Orleans Police say Akein Scott, 22, and Shawn Scott, 26, took up positions on opposite sides of Frenchmen Street as the May 12, 2013 parade passed near North Villere Street, and opened fire at a rival gang member, identified in court records by the initials \"J.T.\"\n\nThe melee was retaliation for a prior shooting that wounded Stanley Scott by members of the Prieur and Columbus Boys, a rival gang also known as \"PCB,\" police said.\n\nNineteen bystanders were wounded, including J.T., who was struck five times, according to court records filed along with Akein, Stanley and Shawn Scott's guilty pleas. Another person was trampled as panicked parade-goers fled the shooting.\n\nProsecutors allege FnD members trafficked heroin and crack cocaine in the 7th Ward dating back to 2006. Nine FnD members, most of them members of the Scott family, were charged in a federal indictment in 2014.\n\nSurveillance video showed the densely packed crowd along the parade route scattering amid the gunshots, images that shocked even city residents accustomed to occasional outbreaks of violence along parade routes.\n\nAmong the those struck by bullets were two 10-year-old children, who suffered graze wounds. The shooter shown in the video, according to court records, was then 20-year-old Akein Scott.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, organizers hosted a \"do over\" of the parade and multiple fundraisers were held for the injured even as police conducted a manhunt for the shooting suspects.\n\nIn court records, FnD members who have pleaded guilty have admitted to selling drugs over a territory bounded by Elysian Fields Avenue, North Johnson, Interstate 10, St. Anthony Street and North Claiborne Avenue.\n\nThe center of the gang's operation was the Frenchmen Meat Market, where workers would hold guns behind the counter for FnD members, and would let patrons swap food stamps for cash that they then handed over to FnD members for heroin or crack.\n\nSurveillance video from the store's own cameras was noted as evidence prosecutors intended to use at trial, with footage showing FnD members making numerous drug deals inside the store.\n\nTravis Scott often carried an AK-47 rifle he called \"monkey nuts,\" a reference to the massive drum magazine that could hold 100 rounds, according to court records.\n\nAkein Scott, now 22, sold drugs at the store several days a week, mostly in the afternoon after returning from school, one unnamed witness said in court records. As one of the younger members of the gang, Akein often was told to hang onto firearms for older gang members, because as a juvenile, he would face less serious penalties from authorities if he was caught with the weapons.\n\nIn court records, Akein Scott admitted to pulling the trigger himself in four shootings during the year before the 2013 Mother's Day parade, joining Shawn and Stanley Scott in a shootout in front of the Frenchmen Meat Market in which a 14-year-old girl riding in a passing vehicle was shot in the leg.\n\nOn Mother's Day 2013, Akein Scott is seen on surveillance video as the second-line parade moves down the block, stepping out from the side of a building with a pistol raised and firing into the terrified marchers, according to court records.\n\nWhen asked about his background by Judge Lemelle on Wednesday, Akein Scott was the only one of the brothers to have completed high school, stating that he attended college in \"Talladega\" and studied business administration. His lawyer, Julie Tizzard, said Akein Scott had been enrolled in college when he was arrested in 2014.\n\nStay with NOLA.com for more on this developing story.", "shooting_date": "2013-05-12", "address": "Frenchmen Street", "n_killed": 0, "n_injured": 19}, {"incident_id": 486316, "title": "Four wounded in Winton Hills market shooting", "publish_date": "2013-05-13", "text": "Four people were wounded in a shooting in Winton Hills.Officers responded to two scenes, one victim was located on Craft Street, another at a market on Kings Run Road, just after 1:30 p.m.An incident report states one man was shot in the face and was found in the Jacob's Market on Kings Run Road.

The judge noted that he was not making any finding of fact, but rather simply summarizing what was alleged to have happened.\n\nAfter the officer sprayed Taylor with mace there was a scuffle and Taylor was shot four times and the officer once in the leg with his own weapon. Court documents indicated that Taylor was alleged to have jumped in front of Ambrifi's patrol car.\n\nIn 2015, Taylor filed a civil lawsuit against Ambrifi, the municipality and others in U.S. District Court in Camden that is still pending, according to court records. In the suit, Taylor alleged that Ambrifi was not properly trained and had used excessive force against him during the altercation.\n\nTaylor, who has been in jail since June 2013, had lost an appeal in July to have the indictment dismissed because the grand jury did not consider his mental issues. A psychological evaluation determined that Taylor is schizophrenic and family and friends said he became obsessed with religion and even death in the days before the incident, according to court documents.\n\nA trial date had been set for January, but Taylor opted instead for the bench trial. Before Delehey ruled that Taylor was not guilty because he was mentally incapacitated during the incident, did not understand the nature of his conduct, and could not determine right from wrong, the state and defense agreed to certain conditions.\n\nBurlington County Assistant Prosecutor Thaddeus Drummond said the state agreed to dismiss all counts of the indictment, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, except for a third-degree offense of resisting arrest. That was the only offense considered by the judge during the trial.\n\nAlso, both sides agreed that Taylor will be sent to a psychiatric facility under what is known as Krol status until June 2018 and will waive his right for two years after that to challenge any finding by mental health professionals that he continue to be committed if he is deemed a risk to himself or others.\n\nThose on Krol status are evaluated annually by a judge to determine if they are a danger to themselves or society and should remain committed.", "shooting_date": "2013-05-14", "address": "Delaware Ave", "n_killed": 0, "n_injured": 2}, {"incident_id": 486327, "title": "4 Shot, 1 Killed During Argument In Detroit \u2013 CBS Detroit", "publish_date": "2013-05-16", "text": "DETROIT (WWJ) \u2013 Four people were wounded and a 60-year-old woman was killed Wednesday after a quiet Detroit neighborhood erupted in gunfire.\n\nThe shooting happened around 8 p.m. a home on the 9000 block of Carlin, near Schaefer and West Chicago, on the city\u2019s west side.\n\nSgt.

He received an additional 93 years suspended upon numerous conditions.\n\nYates also has an additional five years to serve on Nottoway County convictions this year for grand larceny and breaking and entering.\n\nAccording to Commonwealth Attorney Robert Clement, a jury trial was planned for November 4th and 5th, but the defendant expressed a willingness to plead guilty in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence. Clement said that he would have preferred a more significant sentence, but due to a \u201csnitch\u201d mentality among nearly all of the witnesses, he felt more secure with a \u201csure thing\u201d rather than having to count upon reluctant, uncooperative witnesses. \u201cSome refused to talk to law enforcement, and some refused to meet with me,\u201d said Clement. The prosecutor did, however, highly commend one of the victims, Standrekas Woods, for his full cooperation, precise observations, and ability to express his testimony fully and forcefully. Clement added that the victims and law enforcement officers agreed to the disposition.\n\n\u201cIronically, those persons who did not want to \u201csnitch\u201d did not realize that Yates \u201csnitched\u201d on one of his closest friends, Robert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields, the driver of the vehicle. In his interview in Texas where he was found after the shooting, Yates said he had left the party before the shootings, and that Fields had given him the gun to take to Texas later that day. He said Fields admitted to him in a telephone conversation that Fields had shot the men.\n\nFields, on the other hand, would not identify Yates as the shooter in his first four interviews until he was shown the video of Yates in Texas blaming him for the shooting. Fields then went ballistic, calling Yates a liar and saying Yates was the shooter. He then looked right into the camera in the interview room and shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re (deleted) whacked. You are lying. You\u2019re supposed to be my (deleted) brother, man.\u201d He told the investigator to be sure she showed Yates the video of this interview. \u201cDon\u2019t let him miss it.\u201d He then raised his hands up, showing the handcuffs to the camera, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because of you.\u201d\u201d\n\nYates will be under conditions of good behavior for 118 years, supervised probation for five years upon his release, warrant-less searches and seizures, no contact with the victims, restitution for any medical expenses, not knowingly being within 100 feet of any firearms except law enforcement officers and commercial establishments, and staying out of Lunenburg County for ten years upon his release.\n\nAccording to Clement, the charges arose from a shooting at 2073 Pleasant Oak Road, Victoria, Virginia after physical altercations between Lunenburg men and Nottoway men during a birthday party for a Lunenburg female on May 18, 2013.\n\nDetails provided below were taken from a written Stipulation of Evidence signed by the defendant as to what he expected the Commonwealth to prove in court, revealed the following facts:\n\nAll witnesses would have been in agreement that Richsean Hawkes hosted a birthday party cookout for Destiny Brown, a friend. Approximately 25 to 35 individuals eventually showed up.\n\nA number of the witnesses became aware that around 11:30 p.m., Robert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields drove up in his father\u2019s minivan with six friends from Nottoway. (Fields is the father of the baby of Destiny Brown). A number of the witnesses expressed concern that the \u201cNottoway\u201d men had come to the party, because of past tensions with Lunenburg County individuals. They would testify that Brandon Townsend of Lunenburg stood on the front porch at one point and angrily yelled at one of the Nottoway men, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d because of the manner and stance that the Nottoway man posed. Townsend was convinced by some of the women to go back into the house, but came out later and fussed again. One of the Nottoway men yelled something to the effect of not being disrespected in this way. As some of the Lunenburg and Nottoway men became more aggressive, some of the Lunenburg men and women tried to defuse the situation and calm them down. Two of these men who tried to calm things down were the victims, Stan Woods and Dequan Jones. Witnesses would say that Dequan Jones was then jumped and hit from the side, and then fought back. As he was fighting, another Nottoway man tried to get him, but a Lunenburg man pushed him away, and said words to the effect that it would have to be a fair fight, one on one. He pushed the Nottoway man twice to stop him, and they ended up in the road in front of the house. They squared off with each other to fight, and the Lunenburg man hit him in the face with one punch and knocked him out. Stan encouraged Chuckie Fields to get his friend and leave. Chuckie dragged his friend to the minivan, put him inside, and the other Nottoway men got inside also.\n\n(Some of the Nottoway men said the minivan was surrounded and being hit and kicked, but none of the Commonwealth\u2019s Lunenburg witnesses confirmed this.)\n\nAt this point, shots were fired. Five or six witnesses would testify that the shots came from inside the minivan which was parked at the back of the driveway facing the house, with five shots fired through the windshield, and two more shots fired from the side after the van had backed into the road and as it drove away.\n\nThe four victims were hit by the gunfire as described below.\n\nStandrekas \u201cStan\u201d Woods is a 2009 graduate of Central High School, and attended one year at the local community college before becoming a correctional officer for the Virginia Department of Corrections.\n\nStan said that around 11:00 pm or 11:30 p.m., his friend, Richsean Hawkes, called and asked him to come to his house and drive him to town to buy some cigarettes because he had been drinking and did not want to drive. When he came back, he sat on the porch talking to Hawkes and one of the Nottoway men in friendly conversation.\n\nWhen the arguments began, Stan stopped one Lunenburg man from being aggressive toward the Nottoway man who had been on the porch, pointing out that he had not done anything.\n\nStan then went to get his younger brother, Dontaris, in order to leave. He saw the fights described above, and peacefully encouraged the Nottoway men to leave. He and his brother walked to his car in the driveway where it was parked just in front of the minivan. He walked around the front of the car, and Dontaris walked behind the car calling out for a friend who had ridden with him. His car was parked on the road further beyond the driveway.\n\nStan said that as he put the key in lock to the door of his car, he heard two shots, and saw his brother, Dontaris, fall to the ground. He then turned and looked at the minivan, saw two bullet holes in the windshield, and plainly saw the defendant, Codarrell Yates, pointing a handgun toward him from inside the minivan from the back, reaching between the two front seats. The ceiling light was on just above his face, giving Stan a good view of Yates. Stan said Yates yelled, \u201cTHAT\u2019S HOW YA\u2019LL WANT TO PLAY ? AIN\u2019T NO REASON TO RUN NOW.\u201d\n\nStan said he could see Chuckie (Robert Fields) in the driver\u2019s seat, and the light-skinned guy in the passenger seat.\n\nStan said YATES looked at him dead in the face, pointing the gun at him.\n\nSTAN yelled \u201cNO!!!\u201d and saw and heard the shot fired by Yates and felt the bullet hit him in the chest.\n\nSTAN sank down by the car, and played dead. He said he heard two more shots, and then a few seconds later he heard two more shots down the road just as the van accelerated and drove away.\n\nStan looked up and saw they were gone. He said he ran around the car and went up to the sidewalk where he fell.\n\nA friend and other Lunenburg men and women got shirts, towels and sheets and applied pressure to the wounds of the four victims.\n\nStan said he looked up at the moon, which was nearly full, and thought, \u201cThis is the last moon I\u2019m going to see.\u201d\n\nStan was driven to the hospital in South Hill along with Trey Ghee, who had been injured. Dequan Jones and Dontaris Woods were driven to the Victoria Rescue Squad and transported to South Hill. All four men were then transported to MCV Hospital in Richmond.\n\nDequan Jones also attended Central High School. He would testify concerning the fighting described above, and said he then walked over to his car which was parked a little further up the driveway in front of Stan. He would testify that he heard the gunfire and turned to look, but then turned back to the person he had been talking to. He then suddenly felt a burning pain to his right ear. It turned out that a bullet had cut his earlobe and either the same bullet or a second bullet entered the side of his head at the ear while his head was turned sideways. He said he did not see the shooting itself.\n\nDontaris Woods apparently was the first man shot, but said he did not see the shooting itself. He was struck in the face and in his left arm near the wrist.\n\nTreyvious Ghee said he came out of the house and saw the fighting going on. As he and a friend were walking in the yard, he was hit in the side of his head, just above his ear. He fell to the ground unconscious. He also did not see the shooter.\n\nFemale Witness, who will not be identified here at her request, said that she saw a man standing in the minivan \u201cwith hair\u201d (referring, she said, to long braids, like the defendant had) shooting from the side of the minivan as it drove away.\n\nRobert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields was the man who drove the Nottoway men to the party. He is charged as an accomplice (for driving the vehicle as the last shots were fired and getting away from the scene, allowing Yates to flee). He is charged with the same crimes as Yates, except for the possession of a firearm by a felon.\n\nFields was interviewed by law enforcement at least four times, refusing to identify the shooter, at times stating he just heard the shots and ducked down in the driver\u2019s seat, and stating that one of the friends was still unconscious from being knocked out in the fight, and another friend in the front passenger seat fainted when the first shot rang out. He always strongly denied that he had shot the gun. He later said that the police knew who had shot the gun, but he would not say the name.\n\nIn exchange for his agreement to testify against Yates and his agreement to waive the preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth has agreed to allow Fields to plead guilty to one count of malicious wounding as an accomplice and receive one year active sentence.\n\nYates fled to Texas later in the day, driven by a female friend, Deidre Fowlkes. When found by law enforcement officers in Arlington, Texas, Yates ran on foot, and tried to hide in some brush. A tracking dog was used, and he was found lying in some tall grass. At first he would not get up as commanded, but when police threatened to release the dog, he jumped up. He said he had fled to Texas to avoid a sentencing hearing in Nottoway Circuit Court on a conviction of burglary the Monday after the party.", "shooting_date": "2013-05-18", "address": "2073 Pleasant Oak Rd", "n_killed": 0, "n_injured": 4}, {"incident_id": 486586, "title": "4 Shot, 2 Killed In South Memphis Apartment Complex", "publish_date": "2013-05-19", "text": "\u00d7 4 Shot, 2 Killed In South Memphis Apartment Complex\n\n(Memphis) Memphis police are on the scene of a deadly shooting in the Woodbridge Crossing Apartments.\n\nMPD Spokesperson Sgt.

That's more than twice the normal monthly increase and the second most for any month since 1918.\n\nLake Superior usually rises only about 4 inches each May. But thanks to late snow and a cold spring that held back runoff, May more than made up for the difference.\n\nThe lake now sits just 7 inches below its long-term average for June 1.
