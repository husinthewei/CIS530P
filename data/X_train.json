Police say Ward fired into the Badd Boyz Hair and Barber Salon in the 1700 block of Telegraph Avenue just after 4 p.m.\n\nThe four were shot Saturday afternoon moments after the car of a 28-year-old stylist at the salon was broken into and her purse and other valuables taken. The woman\u2019s boyfriend and some others chased Ward down and got back her purse, but Ward got away, authorities said.\n\nPolice said Ward soon returned on a bicycle with a gun about 4:10 p.m. and began firing into the salon.\n\nOf the four wounded, three worked at the salon, including one man who was shot four times. All four have been released from the hospital and are expected to survive.\n\nWard was charged with one count of attempted murder, three counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm, second-degree automobile burglary and violation of probation. Ward has a prior conviction for residential burglary in June 2012. Ward only admitted to the auto burglary, police said.\n\nWard will be prosecuted as a two-strike felon and could face a maximum 25 years to life in prison. He is being held without bail.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the people that really need to be kept behind bars for good,\u201d said Dwayne McCarther, a part owner of the hair salon. \u201cThis is some kind of new generation that is absolutely heartless.\u201d\n\nMcCarther said his employees, including Patrick Fair, were trying to protect their female co-worker. Fair, who was shot in the calf, returned to the hair salon Monday and plans to go back to work as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThese guys are heroes,\u201d McCarther said. \u201cThey were trying to defend a lady and her property.\u201d\n\nInvestigating Officer Anwawn Jones credited patrol officers with getting Ward into custody. Using surveillance photos of Ward, the officers spotted him in the 2100 block of Market Street. Burglary tools, including lockpicks, were found on Ward while he was being taken into custody, police said.\n\nThe arrest also was due to cooperation from victims, who helped identify the shooter, Oakland Interim Chief Sean Whent said Monday. Police said at least one victim of the shooting identified Ward as the gunman.\n\nHistorically, police have had trouble getting witnesses and victims of violent crime in Oakland to cooperate, making arrests difficult.\n\nStaff writer Natalie Alund contributed to this report.

An unidentified man who was with Garcia punched Gomez in the head, who was knocked out after Garcia punched him, as well.\n\nUpon seeing his brother go down, Aaron Gomez tried to stop the assault by pushing Garcia back but rather than stop the assault, Garcia turned the gun on Aaron Gomez and fired at many as five times, the complaint states.\n\nTwo police sergeants working the downtown at the intersection of 17th Street and Beaumont heard the shots and ran south towards Emiliano\u2019s when they saw Garcia running away while trying to put his gun in his waistband, one of the sergeants wrote in his report.\n\nThe police sergeants chased Garcia and caught up to him when he stumbled into a group of people, which is when they grabbed one arm and took him to the ground, the sergeants said, describing how Garcia put the gun down and pushed it toward the crowd.\n\nOnce authorities recovered the gun, they saw that it had one round in the chamber and one in the magazine. Since that model holds six rounds in the magazine and can hold one more round in the chamber, it remains unclear whether four or five shots were fired.\n\nPolice have said that Garcia is a member of the Mexican Mafia prison gang, but court records to not identify gang affiliation as a possible motive in the case.\n\nAaron Gomez was rushed to McAllen Medical Center where surgeons worked to remove one round from his abdomen. He suffered gunshot wounds to both of his thighs and on his right hand, which he had put in front of him in an effort to protect his face, the complaint states.\n\niortiz@themonitor.com", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "TSA Week in Review: April 1 - 7 April 11, 2019 | 6 (# of comments) Winter is coming!

Foster was one of five people shot Thursday, and on Friday morning, a 52-year-old woman was found dead inside her home overlooking Patterson Park in Highlandtown in what police were investigating as a burglary gone wrong.\n\nThe killings swelled the city's number of homicides in January to 27, equaling the number killed last June when the city was besieged by a wave of shootings. January is typically a quieter month, with an average of 13 slain over the past four years.\n\nSimpson-Foster said her husband was well-liked on his street, shoveling snow or helping with back-to-school events. He had no criminal record.\n\nWhen they arrived home from their trip to the store, the 4200 block of Walrad St. was still. Simpson-Foster walked into the house to the kitchen, and her 32-year-old son asked Foster to start his car for him. Foster obliged and went back outside.\n\nSimpson-Foster said she didn't hear a sound, but suddenly her son yelled for her to call 911. Her son and a neighbor urged her not to look outside.\n\n\"All I could see was my husband laying in the middle of the street,\" she said.\n\nA car could be seen driving off down the street, she said.\n\nPolice haven't released any information on suspects or a motive.\n\nSimpson-Foster said that her neighborhood has seen some incidents over the years, but she has not feared violence against her family.\n\n\"This city \u2026\" she said. \"I don't know what needs to be done. But something needs to be done.\"\n\nFor the first time in at least a decade, Foster will not help set up the Great Chesapeake Bay Swim, an annual charitable fundraiser for the Maryland chapter of the March of Dimes, where Foster has been a longtime volunteer.\n\n\"It's a devastating blow to me, to our staff, to everyone at the March of Dimes,\" race director Chuck Nabit said. \"He was such a wonderful, dedicated and tirelessly hardworking volunteer. A really exceptional human being.\"\n\nFoster was one of just a handful people who set up and broke down event banners and tables and provided food for athletes at the race's starting point and finish line, Nabit said. Over the course of the race weekend in June, he put in between 25 and 30 hours of his own time on the Eastern Shore.\n\n\"He just had a big heart,\" said Nabit, calling the loss \"senseless.\" \"He was a very giving individual.\"\n\nWithin the Central Maryland division of the March of Dimes, Foster had been a do-everything leader for more than 25 years.\n\n\"He is our No. 1 guy when it comes to anything logistics driven,\" said Jennifer Tarr, a March of Dimes division director who spoke with him just a week ago to begin planning for the March for Babies event in the spring. \"There is no job too big or too small for him.\"\n\nIn Highlandtown, the unidentified victim died in a rowhouse in the 400 block of S. Ellwood Ave. Behind crime scene tape in the rear of the home, a chair from an outdoor furniture set was pushed below the kitchen window, which was open.\n\nPolice did not provide additional details, but a neighbor who did not want to be identified said investigators told her they believed it was a burglary.\n\nFrom the front of the home, nothing appeared out of the ordinary except for two marked police SUVs parked on the street.\n\n\"This is unusual for this block,\" said neighbor Greg Atkins. \"Trust me, my eyes are open all the time.\"\n\nA police spokesman said officers discovered the woman's body about 7:30 a.m. after receiving a 911 call from someone reporting an unconscious person. The woman had suffered trauma to the body, police said, declining to specify.\n\nCity Council member James B. Kraft, who represents Highlandtown, said he requested additional officers, including on foot patrol, in the neighborhood before Christmas and again this year.\n\nHe said the mayor's administration and police commanders told him the department is too understaffed to fulfill the requests.\n\n\"I don't have a gun.

View Full Caption DNAinfo/Benjamin Woodard\n\nROGERS PARK \u2014 Rapper Young Pappy survived a shooting attempt that left a 17-year-old dead outside a Rogers Park McDonald's, and later was unscathed when a bullet intended for him killed a photographer waiting for a bus instead, police have said.\n\nBut earlier this month, the rapper \u2014 whose real name is Shaquon Thomas \u2014 allegedly went back to that same McDonald's at 6740 N. Clark St., where he got in a fight with a man who later was shot across the street from the restaurant, police said.\n\nNow, Thomas \u2014 whom authorities have told residents about at community meetings \u2014 is in jail.\n\nHe is locked up on $50,000 bail while awaiting a Thursday court hearing.\n\nBen Woodard spoke to Thomas' mother about her son's arrest:\n\nThomas was charged with marijuana possession and reckless conduct on Jan. 14 after he was arrested at his mother's home, according to a police report.\n\nThe 18-year-old man he got into a fight with was shot in the leg about 11:50 a.m. Police said the victim was cooperating in the investigation, but no charges have been filed in the shooting.\n\nThomas is no stranger to gunplay.\n\nLast February, surveillance video captured a masked gunman opening fire on the rapper and the group he was walking with outside the McDonald's, striking him in the arm and killing 17-year-old Markeyo Carr, whose family lives in the same building as Thomas' mother. While Markeyo was with the group, his relatives have said he was not in a gang.\n\nThen, on July 12, photographer Wil Lewis was killed by a stray bullet when another shooter opened fire at the rapper, who was walking in the 1300 block of Devon Avenue, police said. Lewis had been waiting for a bus and was shot in the back.\n\nThe rapper celebrated his 19th birthday in jail during the time between the shootings. He served about two months of a one-year sentence for unlawful use of a weapon/vehicle, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections.\n\nNow, Thomas is back in jail.\n\nOn Jan. 14, the rapper could be seen on surveillance camera footage \"verbally assaulting\" the man who later was shot, according to a police report. The commotion caused customers to rush out of the restaurant.\n\nAfter the altercation, officers responded to shots fired in the 1600 block of West Columbia Avenue, where they found the victim, the report said.\n\nOfficers then went to Thomas' mother's home, where the rapper's mother allowed officers to search the apartment, the report said.\n\nThomas was found inside the unit, the report said. Before leaving, Thomas asked for his jacket. When officers searched the jacket, they found four knotted plastic bags containing pot, according to the report. The red-and-black jacket with an \"Indian\" on the back matched the description of someone who was seen fleeing the scene of the shooting, the report said.\n\nA $50,000 bail was set for Thomas in court the next day, according to court records.\n\nThomas' mother, Ingrid Thomas, said Thursday there was no evidence to prove her son was the target of any shootings.\n\n\"I could believe that if my son was the only person out there, but he wasn't,\" she said, standing at the front door of the home where her son was arrested two weeks earlier. \"I don't believe the police. They don't have proof.\"\n\nShe said her son had straight As in grade school, but began hanging around a bad crowd at Sullivan High School. (The police report of the most recent shooting incident described him as a known member of the Insane Cutthroat Gangstas, a Gangster Disciples street gang in Rogers Park.)\n\nNow, she fears for her son's life, she said.\n\n\"It's very scary, and it's very frustrating,\" she said.\n\nShe said when her son was arrested, police entered her home with guns drawn. They later searched the home for hours \"looking for a gun,\" she said, but didn't find any.\n\nShe said the police are \"painting my son as someone that he's not.\"\n\n\"I'm not arguing with the police, but you can't believe everything they say,\" she said.\n\nThomas recently had been introduced to a Chicago Police Department program that refers people at risk of gun violence to social services, such as job training.\n\nIn addition to the recent incident, Thomas has other convictions in his background: In June 2013, he was convicted of felony unlawful use of a weapon and sentenced to two years probation, court records show, but he violated that probation and was sentenced to a year in prison.\n\nThe following year, Thomas racked up four misdemeanor convictions for retail theft, criminal trespass and two counts of reckless conduct, and was sentenced to a total of 65 days in jail.\n\nBetween stints in jail, the well-known rapper racked up more than 50,000 views on one of his most recent YouTube music videos, titled \"Savages.\"\n\nThe song includes an apparent reference to the shootings.\n\n\"...Tried to set me up, but you missed n----,\" he raps.\n\nThomas has also published a video with fellow rapper and Insane Cutthroat Gangsta Keith Hayer, aka Bang Da Hitta.\n\nThe duo seems to have a close bond. Since Thomas was locked up, Hayer has been posting messages to his Facebook page calling for Thomas' release.\n\nContributing: Erica Demarest, Erin Meyer\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:", "publish_date": "2015-01-30"}, {"text": "A 52-year-old College Park man has been extradited from New York to Atlanta, where he is charged with murder.\n\nMartin McGriff is accused of shooting Anthony Holland, 42, of Atlanta, on Jan. 8 after an argument on English Avenue in northwest Atlanta, police said.\n\nHe was arrested in New York on Feb. 13 and returned to Georgia.\n\nHe had a first court appearance on Valentine\u2019s Day and was denied bond, Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said.\n\nMcGriff remains in the Fulton County Jail.\n\nSupport real journalism.

He was in jail at the time. Also, his attempted murder charge in an unrelated shooting was reduced to attempted first-degree assault, for which he was convicted.\n\nA Talent couple are suing two moving companies for $3,283,000 after a man who helped move their possessions later returned with an accomplice and took part in a robbery that included beating the husband.\n\nThe case is scheduled to go to trial at the end of October in Jackson County Circuit Court.\n\nThe elderly couple and their daughter Lori Ward, who has been appointed their guardian, brought the lawsuit against Lile North American Moving and Storage, which has a branch in Medford, and California-based Elite Moving Solutions.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple hired Elite Moving Solutions to truck the couple's possessions from California to their new home in Talent. Elite Moving Solutions allegedly got a referral from Lile Moving and Storage in Medford to use two local men to help unpack the truck.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Lile Moving and Storage failed to do criminal background checks on the men. It claims the Medford company habitually referred untrained, unvetted day laborers to other moving companies to help their drivers unload trucks \u2014 and expected those companies to return the favor when Lile needed help outside the area.\n\nThe resulting robbery and assault on the husband were not the result of highly unusual circumstances, as claimed by the moving companies' lawyers, but a \"natural and foreseeable result of allowing criminals into the sanctuary of the (couple's) home,\" the couple's attorney, Kelly Andersen, alleged in a court document. \"To prevent such access by such people is precisely why criminal background checks should have been done in the first place,\" Andersen said.\n\nIn July 2013, Curtis Lee Wiles, who had a past assault conviction, and Jason Ray Morgan were helping move the couple's possessions into the house when they dropped a box. Wiles estimated about $20,000 worth of jewelry fell out, according to a June 4, 2014, interview between Wiles and the Jackson County Sheriff's Office.\n\nWiles said they also talked to the husband, who said he didn't trust banks. Wiles said he believed the husband was Jewish and \"figured he would have money,\" according to a sheriff's report on the interview.\n\nThe two movers casually mentioned robbing the home, saying, \"If anyone needed to rob a place, it would be a good one,\" Wiles said, according to the sheriff's report.\n\nMorgan later told investigators that he and Wiles noticed items of value during the move and made mental notes about the property.\n\nIn a deposition Morgan gave from prison, he alleged that in November 2013, he, Wiles and a woman returned to the home with the intention of robbing the place.\n\nThe woman went to the house, said her car had broken down and asked to use the phone. When she returned to the car, she told the men she had seen children in the house. The trio decided to abort their robbery attempt, Morgan alleged in the deposition.\n\nThe need for money came to a head in February 2014 after Wiles shot a man in the hip who was inside a vehicle with a woman and a child. Lodged at the Jackson County Jail on attempted murder and other charges, Wiles wanted to raise money for his bail, according to monitored phone calls he made to Morgan and another woman that are detailed in a sheriff's report.\n\nThe three discussed an idea to have Morgan return to the house of the \"Jews in Talent\" to get money for Wiles' bail, according to the report.\n\nWith Wiles locked in jail, another man, James Lewis Turner, agreed to help Morgan rob the couple's house, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"All three men intended to split their plunder, using some of it to bail Wiles out of jail,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nOn May 3, 2014, Morgan and Turner, wearing masks and carrying at least one shotgun, entered the couple's house. The husband was savagely beaten in the head, back and torso with the barrel and butt of the shotgun. The two intruders then stuffed the husband and wife in a small water-heater closet, propping a door against the door so they couldn't escape. The thieves stole jewelry, cash, coins and a car, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe couple were trapped in the closet until they were found and let out by a sheriff's deputy, according to a sheriff's office report.\n\nThe husband told investigators the robbers had taken about $45,000 in cash stored in a cardboard box, plus silver coins and bullion worth $25,000 to $35,000. About $1,500 to $2,000 worth of jewelry was missing. He said the robbers had put the items in a black suitcase they found in the house, the report said.\n\nIn June 2014, Wiles was convicted of a lesser charge of attempted first-degree assault, unlawful use of a weapon and delivery of methamphetamine for the incident in which he shot the man in the hip, according to court records.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, Morgan and Turner pleaded guilty in the robbery case and were each sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison. They were also ordered to pay restitution, court records show.\n\nMoving company safety\n\nIn the lawsuit on behalf of the couple, Andersen said Lile North American Moving and Storage is misleading customers by claiming to use certified movers.\n\n\"I don't think the public has any idea when they engage a professional moving company that they're not getting what's represented on the website and in the ads,\" Andersen said in a phone interview. \"If the truck is from outside the area, the people doing the unloading are often minimally skilled day laborers who don't go through any criminal background check.\"\n\nThe Medford branch's website continues to say it uses American Moving and Storage Association certified moving consultants, and courteous, professionally trained crews to ensure a safe, easy and stress-free move.\n\nThe Medford company did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nIn a deposition, a representative from Elite Moving Systems said it's common for moving companies to contact other moving companies in an area to get recommendations for temporary, trained, experienced helpers to unload trucks. The representative said Elite trusted Lile because it was on an American Moving and Storage Association roster.\n\nHe said Lile has \"a reliable source to help with these moves. This is what all moving companies in the country do. Obviously you can't put a crew of seven or eight people in a truck. And most drivers travel alone, so we all need help unloading, and this is what they do.\"\n\nRalph Spooner, attorney for Elite Moving Systems, declined to comment due to the pending litigation.\n\nBen Veralrud, an attorney for Lile North American Moving and Storage, disputed that Lile ever referred Wiles and Morgan to help unload the Talent couple's possessions. Regardless, he said a moving company should not be blamed for a robbery, especially one that occurs months later as part of an alleged scheme to raise bail money.\n\nVeralrud said it wouldn't be fair to hold the moving company liable.\n\n\"The unfortunate, tragic home invasion by these two criminals was not linked in any way to an act by Lile,\" Veralrud said. \"It was the result of independent criminal conduct by these two individuals.\"\n\n\u2014 Reach staff reporter Vickie Aldous at 541-776-4486 or .

Edgefield County Sheriff's Office\n\nWhile the nation\u2019s attention was riveted Tuesday on murder charges filed in one police shooting, South Carolina officials quietly arrested a second officer in connection with a fatal shooting last year.\n\nJustin Gregory Craven, 25, a white public safety officer in North Augusta, was charged with discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle, a felony, in the February 2014 death of black motorist Ernest Satterwhite, 68.\n\nCraven, who has been on administrative leave since the shooting, was booked Tuesday into the Edgefield County jail, state officials said.

There, investigators say, after Satterwhite stopped in his driveway, Craven fired repeatedly into the vehicle through the driver-side door.\n\nThe State Law Enforcement Division, which investigates most police shootings in South Carolina, announced the charges against Craven on the same day that another white police officer, Michael Slager, was charged with murder in the death of a black man, Walter Scott, in North Charleston, S.C.\n\nIn both cases, the victims were initially approached by police during a traffic stop.

He is accused of robbing a woman in River Ridge on Monday (Jan. 13) and forcing her to drive to a relative's home for more money.\n\n(JPSO)\n\nAuthorities say a 15-year-old boy robbed a woman in River Ridge Monday night, kidnapped her at gunpoint and forced her to drive to a relative's home in search of more money. Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office deputies arrested the teenager after the victim's aunt shoved him out of her apartment and called for help.\n\n\"It shook us all up,\" said the robbery victim's 52-year-old aunt. NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune is not identifying the women.\n\nThe ordeal began just before 9:20 p.m. at a residence in the 300 block of Bengal Road in River Ridge. The robbery victim, a 25-year-old woman from Mississippi, told investigators a man with a wool hat covering his face and head approached her armed with large, rust-covered pistol and demanded money, said Col. John Fortunato, spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"He wanted her money or her life,\" the aunt said.\n\nThe woman told the robber she had none, but thought she might be able to get some cash from a relative. The robber ordered her into her car, and the two drove to the aunt's Marion Court apartment in River Ridge, Fortunato said.\n\nThe aunt said her frightened niece purposely selected a relative's house. She was afraid the robber might kill her away from family in a place where her body might not be found.\n\n\"She said, 'If he is going to kill me, he's going to do it around my people,'\" the aunt said.\n\nOn the way over, the robber took $14 in cash that was in the niece's vehicle. The robber hid his pistol underneath his clothing when he went inside the apartment and seemed to try to chat up an older male relative who was present, witnesses said.\n\nThe niece woke her aunt, who said she quickly rushed up front, pushed the robber out of her apartment, locked the front door and called authorities.\n\n\"I was scared,\" the aunt said. \"I don't now. I just react to stuff. I just pushed him on out.\"\n\nThe robber fled on foot. East Jefferson Levee District Police officer Blake Vining and Sgt. Tyrone Butler spotted a suspect matching the robber's description walking about a half-mile away on Jefferson Highway and Starrett Road, Fortunato said.\n\nAuthorities identified the teenager as Deymon Rose of Kenner. They said he was carrying a .45-caliber pistol that matched the victim's description. Authorities arrested booked him at Rivarde Juvenile Detention Center in Harvey with armed robbery, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated burglary and being a juvenile in possession of a firearm, Fortunato said.\n\nThe aunt said detectives returned her niece's $14. The family said they are grateful no one was hurt during the robbery.

The judge noted that he was not making any finding of fact, but rather simply summarizing what was alleged to have happened.\n\nAfter the officer sprayed Taylor with mace there was a scuffle and Taylor was shot four times and the officer once in the leg with his own weapon. Court documents indicated that Taylor was alleged to have jumped in front of Ambrifi's patrol car.\n\nIn 2015, Taylor filed a civil lawsuit against Ambrifi, the municipality and others in U.S. District Court in Camden that is still pending, according to court records. In the suit, Taylor alleged that Ambrifi was not properly trained and had used excessive force against him during the altercation.\n\nTaylor, who has been in jail since June 2013, had lost an appeal in July to have the indictment dismissed because the grand jury did not consider his mental issues. A psychological evaluation determined that Taylor is schizophrenic and family and friends said he became obsessed with religion and even death in the days before the incident, according to court documents.\n\nA trial date had been set for January, but Taylor opted instead for the bench trial. Before Delehey ruled that Taylor was not guilty because he was mentally incapacitated during the incident, did not understand the nature of his conduct, and could not determine right from wrong, the state and defense agreed to certain conditions.\n\nBurlington County Assistant Prosecutor Thaddeus Drummond said the state agreed to dismiss all counts of the indictment, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, except for a third-degree offense of resisting arrest. That was the only offense considered by the judge during the trial.\n\nAlso, both sides agreed that Taylor will be sent to a psychiatric facility under what is known as Krol status until June 2018 and will waive his right for two years after that to challenge any finding by mental health professionals that he continue to be committed if he is deemed a risk to himself or others.\n\nThose on Krol status are evaluated annually by a judge to determine if they are a danger to themselves or society and should remain committed.", "publish_date": "2017-12-14"}, {"text": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

By the same time last year, the city had seen just one homicide.\n\nAt a news conference, police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said he was \"acutely aware\" of the violence since New Year's Day. He characterized the incidents as \"a little bit more random\" than usual, which makes them more difficult to anticipate.\n\nPolice said they are responding to the crime by adjusting their deployments and adding manpower to street patrols. \"We will maintain and sustain our initiatives,\" Batts said.\n\nPolice said the Charles North case began about 2 a.m., when Hopkins shot a person in a car on Maryland Avenue near West 22nd Street. As police arrived, he holed up in the nearby offices of the Family Tree, which serves abused and neglected children. Police believe Hopkins selected the location at random; officials at the nonprofit organization could not be reached for comment.\n\nHe was dead by 10:30 a.m., when police sent a robot into the building.\n\n\"Most likely, we're looking at a multitude of other crimes we think he might be responsible for or connected to at the beginning of the year,\" Batts said during a news conference at police headquarters. Officers had were seeking him on a warrant for an incident Dec. 28 and said witnesses had identified him in two other cases.\n\nPolice said they found a gun near Hopkins' body and believe it was the weapon used in the suicide and earlier fatal shooting. The victim in the 2 a.m. shooting, who was dead when police arrived, was identified as 28-year-old Spencer Falcon.\n\nPolice said Hopkins' crime spree is believed to have begun Dec. 28 with the theft of a vehicle. The vehicle's owner tracked it down using an OnStar security device and saw Hopkins. Police said Hopkins robbed the victim of $200 and then fired a gun as the man fled.\n\nAt 2:30 a.m. Jan. 8, police said, Hopkins shot another driver in a sedan in the 3400 block of Reisterstown Road. The victim's injuries were not life-threatening.\n\nAfter noon that day, police said, Hopkins entered a sedan in the 1100 block of N.

Photo: Arnold Gold \u2014 New Haven Register File Photo Photo: Arnold Gold \u2014 New Haven Register File Photo Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close New Haven defendant pleads guilty in fatal Key Club shooting on second day of trial 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nNEW HAVEN >> Adrian Bennett, accused of killing Erika Robinson and wounding five others, abruptly halted his trial Tuesday morning and pleaded guilty in the 2013 fatal shooting at the Key Club in New Haven.\n\nDefense attorney Donald Cretella said after the pleas were entered that Bennett realized the prosecution testimony was going to be hard to overcome in the minds of the jurors. Cretella said Tuesday morning\u2019s testimony by New Haven Police Detective Marcin Podsiad identifying Bennett as the man in the white pompom hat opening fire in the club\u2019s surveillance videotape \u201cput it over the top.\u201d\n\nBut Cretella said Bennett also decided to plead guilty because \u201che didn\u2019t want the (Robinson\u2019s) family to have to watch the video again. The video showed their daughter\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing in which Bennett pleaded guilty, Robinson\u2019s father, Gregory Fulcher, said he is still angry at Bennett. Looking straight at Bennett, Fulcher added, \u201cBut I thank you for not putting us through any more agony.\u201d\n\nBennett pleaded guilty to the most serious charge of murder and to five of the 10 assault counts. He originally also was charged with first-degree manslaughter with a firearm and two weapons counts. The original assault charges carried two counts for each of the five wounded victims: one each for first-degree assault/discharging a firearm and first-degree assault/extreme indifference to life. The \u201cextreme indifference to life\u201d assault counts were dropped, along with the manslaughter and weapons charges, in the agreement Cretella worked out with Senior Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Michael Pepper and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Lisa D\u2019Angelo.\n\nBut Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Clifford told Bennett he still faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 193\u00bd years when he returns to court Feb. 4, 2016. That\u2019s because Bennett could get up to 60 years for murder, up to 20 years for each of the assault counts and was exposed to 33\u00bd years for violating probation connected to a previous conviction.\n\nOne month before the club shootings, he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell, for which he received a five-year prison sentence, and he then violated probation by committing the crimes at the club. At that point he had not begun serving the five-year sentence.\n\nClifford told Bennett, who was stoic as he acknowledged all this information, that he must serve a minimum of 25 years. Bennett apparently believes he still will receive a lesser sentence than if he had continued with the trial and been convicted.\n\nThe trial had opened Monday with jurors repeatedly viewing surveillance videotape showing the shooting at the club on St. John Street at 3:30 a.m. Oct. 26, 2013. Some members of Robinson\u2019s family were so upset by the tape that they quickly left the courtroom.\n\nBennett, now 30, of Howard Avenue, had shown no emotion as he watched the videotape.\n\nThe other victims were Jahad Brumsey, Nijia Ward, Albert Dickerson, Amanda John and Ivette Sterling. They ranged in age from 19 to 34. Robinson, who lived in West Haven, was 26.\n\nAccording to the police warrant, a source quoted Bennett as saying he intended just to shoot Brumsey and nobody else. Brumsey, shot repeatedly in his abdomen, probably was the most seriously injured after Robinson. She was shot once and pronounced dead shortly after she arrived at Yale-New Haven Hospital.\n\nTuesday morning\u2019s testimony was provided by Podsiad, a plainclothes detective who said he knows Bennett as someone in the Newhallville neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve been in his presence on more than one occasion.\u201d\n\nWhile Pepper screened a videotape of patrons being checked by security guards at the Lazy Lizard on Crown Street in the hours before the Key Club shooting, Podsiad identified Bennett as one of the men leaving and entering. That club closed at 2 a.m.\n\nPepper then showed a videotape of a man Podsiad identified as Bennett entering the Key Club. He said Bennett was the figure wearing a white pompom hat.\n\nOther surveillance cameras showed that man\u2019s appearances in other rooms of the club in the ensuing minutes. But before Pepper reached the point of the shooting, during which Podsiad was expected to identify Bennett as the gunman, Superior Court Judge Brian T. Fischer suspended testimony for the mid-morning recess.\n\nThe jury never heard another moment of testimony.

She was left not far from the road. Her body was found in the morning by surveyors.\n\nLast year, a jury convicted Patterson of murder, two counts of felony murder, kidnapping, robbery and hindering. At sentencing, Delehey dismissed the hindering charge and merged the murder counts. He sentenced Patterson to life without parole for murder, 30 years for kidnapping and 20 years for robbery, all to be served at the same time.\n\nPatterson appealed the conviction and his sentence. Last month, the New Jersey Appellate Division upheld the conviction, but reversed his sentence and sent the matter back to the trial court.\n\nThe appeals court found that Delehey erred in his consideration of Patterson's criminal history, in that he had been convicted in 1993 of second-degree robbery, not first-degree robbery. Patterson was also convicted of first-degree robbery in 1999. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2001 for that robbery and was paroled on Aug. 4, 2013, just months before he killed Armstrong.\n\nThe trial court incorrectly applied what is known as the \"three strikes\" rule in sentencing Patterson to life without parole, the appeals court ruled.\n\nAlso, the judge incorrectly applied a 20-year sentence on the robbery charge. The appeals court found that it should have been a second-degree offense punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison.\n\nGiven the ruling, Delehey resentenced Patterson to 10 years for the robbery charge and kept the 30-year term for kidnapping. Both will be served at the same time as the life term.\n\nDelehey was not swayed by defense attorney Anthony Rizzo's call for a 40-year term, with 85 percent to be served without the chance for parole. Rizzo argued that since the three-strikes provision was incorrectly levied and Patterson has shown good behavior in prison, he should get less than a life term.\n\nBurlington County Assistant Prosecutor LaChia Bradshaw disagreed, citing Patterson's record and his prior incarcerations, and reiterated that the murder was committed not long after he was paroled from prison.\n\nJahyda Bennett-Wilson, Armstrong's daughter, said her family continues to be affected by the murder.\n\n\"I have lost my faith and trust in people,\" Bennett-Wilson said. \"My mother had a heart as big as the world. ... It breaks my heart into pieces.\"\n\nShe was emotional when telling Delehey that a \"big part\" of her died when her mother was killed, and that she wished she could have protected her.\n\n\"She died terrified and alone,\" Bennett-Wilson said. \"Mom, you will never be forgotten.\"\n\nAfter the proceedings, Bennett-Wilson said the wounds are reopened every time the family has to come to court.\n\n\"I just want it to end so I can begin to get closure,\" she said. \"He's done enough harm to our family.\"", "publish_date": "2017-11-09"}, {"text": "CHARLOTTE, NC (WBTV) - Police in Charlotte are asking for the public's help in locating who they call a violent criminal.\n\n\n\nBrandon Douglas Warren is wanted by police on outstanding warrants for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, attempted robbery, shooting into occupied property and firearm by felon stemming from a shooting that occurred on Jan. 31, at the 4900 block of Cinderella Road in Charlotte, according to the news release from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "SPRINGFIELD \u2014 Police continue to probe the armed robbery of a Forest Park neighborhood convenience store Sunday night.\n\nSgt.

An 18-year-old boy is dead and three other teens were shot all because this defendant decided to commit senseless and terrible acts of violence. Now he will pay for what he did by being locked up for most of his life.\u201d\n\nThe District Attorney identified the defendant as Brandon Reese, 21, of Brooklyn. He was today sentenced by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Sheryl Parker to 47 years to life in prison following his conviction earlier this month on one count of second-degree murder, one count of second-degree attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, one count of first-degree attempted assault, one count of second-degree assault, one count of second-degree attempted assault, one count of first-degree reckless endangerment, and two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon following a jury trial.\n\nThe District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, on July 6, 2013, at approximately 6:30 p.m., at the Marcy Houses, located at 472 Marcy Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, during a basketball tournament two rival crews engaged in a dispute which ultimately resulted in a shooting.\n\nThe District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, a number of gang members from Bushwick Houses, who belong to a crew named Young Stackers (YS), were hanging out in front of Marcy Houses. A member of Stack Money Goonz (SMG) walked by and realized that one of the YS\u2019s had previously pulled a gun on him. He then called his older brother, the defendant, Brandon Reese, for back-up.\n\nThe District Attorney further said that, according to trial testimony, after an argument ensued between his brother and the YS kids, the defendant pulled his gun from his waistband and fired approximately nine shots. Mario Lopez was shot approximately eight times and pronounced dead later that evening. Three others were injured: A 13-year-old shot in the neck with the bullet exiting his nose was left with permanent partial paralysis of his face; a second 13-year-old was shot in the knee; a 15-year-old was grazed on the hip and suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe case was investigated by now retired New York City Police Detective James Tischler and other detectives assigned to the NYPD\u2019s 79th precinct.\n\nThe case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Chavis, Chief of the District Attorney\u2019s Violent Criminal Enterprises Bureau, with the assistance of Assistant District Attorney Iris Das, under the supervision of Executive Assistant District Attorney William E.

Oil train derailments \u2013 are we ready? January 18, 2014 - In the last seven months three oil trains have derailed and exploded resulting in towns being evacuated, and 47 people killed. The number of oil train shipments, carrying oil from the N. Dakota oil fields, and the Canadian tar sand fields, to refinery in the south, has skyrocketed in the last few years to an all time record. Approximately 50 freight trains pass through Prairie du Chien, WI on a typical day, many are oil trains pulling 100 oil tanker cars. The sheer number of these shipments means that while the chance of a derailment and explosion is still unlikely, it is much more likely now than it was just a few years ago.\n\nConsidering that oil trains transit many small towns through Grant and Crawford Counties, Midwest News wanted to know if city planners and emergency personal have plans in place to deal with a train derailment and explosion. Midwest News talked with Crawford County Emergency Management Director Roger Martin See video. Armed man surrenders after 12 hour standoff On Sunday January 19, 2014 at approx. 3:30 p,m. Dispatch received a call of an ongoing domestic on Cyprus Lane in Bridgeport Township. As officers responded the information gathered was that a 36 year old male had gotten into an argument with his 34 year old wife at their rural Bridgeport home.\n\nDuring the argument and prior to officers arriving the 36 year old male had barricaded himself inside his bedroom with numerous weapons. Sheriff Deputies arrived and took the wife of the man along with their four children out of the home and to safety. The Crawford County Crisis Resolution Team (CRT) was activated. The team is made up of members of the Crawford County Sheriff Dept., Prairie du Chien Police Dept. and the Wisconsin State Patrol. The home was surrounded by members of the CRT team, Crawford County Sheriff Deputies and Prairie du Chien Police Department officers. Myself, Prairie du Chien Police Chief Chad Abram and the two CRT Team leaders discussed our options in this situation said Sheriff McCullick. We decided based on the fact that the General Public was in no way threatened, and the man was confined to his bedroom we were going to secure the residence and wait him out, added McCullick.\n\nWe had constant voice contact with the subject and we were continually attempting to talk him out of the room. We made it as uncomfortable inside the home as we could, said McCullick and eventually he came out. At 3:15 a.m. almost 12 hours after the initial call came in, the 36 year old man placed his gun outside the bedroom and walked out to our officers. The outcome was exactly what we wanted, Said McCullick. The male subject was extremely paranoid and delusional and sometimes those types of situations don\u2019t end this well. All of the officers involved in this did a great job. We want to thank Tri State Ambulance as well, they were put on standby and they had an ambulance waiting less than a mile from the scene during the entire situation. Will the LP shortage affect us?

How do you say you\u2019re sorry, that you feel for their loss? Words often fail, but doing something to show your compassion is just the thing. That's what happened when Scott and Kari Brown of Whippoorwill Lane in rural Boscobel lost their 12 year old son, Briar in a tragic gun related accident on February 11th. Someone thought that providing firewood might be of help during this cold winter, and a way to show support. So the word went out for volunteers to cut up and haul firewood.\n\nTodd and Deanna Sander donated part of a wood lot on their property bordering Harvest Lane. On Sunday, February 16th, neighbors from miles around arrived with chainsaws, pickup trucks, log splitters, and all manner of heavy equipment. There were perhaps 30 to 40 pickup trucks, and upwards of 100 people cutting, hauling, splitting, and loading pickup trucks with load after load of firewood.\n\nA Canadian logging operation had nothing on this group. The hill was alive with the sounds of chainsaws, and tractors pulling trees up the hill. Men and women bent to the task with enthusiasm knowing they were sending a heartfelt message of community support to the Brown family. We can all feel proud that we have neighbors this caring. Meth lab busted, 3 arrested, 2 children removed Vincent Dahlberg Andrea Dahlberg Kellene Cull On February 13th, 2014 following an eight month investigation into the manufacturing of methamphetamine (meth) the Crawford County Sheriffs Department obtained and executed a search warrant at 13812 State highway 27, in the unincorporated Town of Fairview, Utica Township.\n\nAt 5:25 p.m. on February 16th members of law enforcement began the execution of the search warrant at the home occupied by Vincent and Andrea Dahlberg. While doing so, numerous items associated with the manufacturing, delivery, and sale of meth where located in and around the residence. The remnants of several \u201cone-pot\u201d meth labs found at the scene suggest the manufacturing practices have been taking place for sometime.\n\nThree adults were taken into custody during the execution of the search warrant. Vincent Dahlberg, age 51; Andrea dahlberg, age 37, and Kellene Cull, age 41. Vincent and Andrea Dahlberg were arrested on charges of manufacturing meth, possession of meth, and possession of schedule 2 narcotics. Cull was arrested on an outstanding warrant issued through Crawford County and may face charges associated with this investigation.\n\nVincent and Andrea Dahlberg could also face charges of child endangerment for exposing the two young children, who also reside at the residence, to the volatile process of meth manufacturing. The two children were removed from the residence by Crawford County Human Services for their safety. This case remains under investigation. Recalls up to date,\n\nreason for loss of power still unknown Bob Welsh\u2019s view of Mill Road as the brakes and power steering went out on his school bus. Update - February 24, 2014 - District Administrator Dr. Michael Garrow personally checked with Thomas Bus company, and determmined that the school bus in question had all required recalls performed. His letter is as follows:\n\nFebruary 24, 2014 Re: Transportation Services and Thomas Bus Recalls From: Dr. Michael S. Garrow After speaking directly with a representative from Thomas Built Buses, I was able to confirm that Bus #22 - the bus which experienced the loss of electrical power on February 6, 2014 has no recalls on it that have not been addressed/updated. The bus in question is a 2008 Thomas Saf-T-Liner EF bus purchased by the School District of Wauzeka-Steuben on June 29, 2007. Since the purchase of the bus, there have been four recalls that were noted to be addressed. 1) a PC board issue \u2013 addressed in May, 2008; 2) a steering arm recall\u2013 also addressed in May, 2008; 3) a door handle issue (to avoid corrosion) \u2013 addressed in October, 2008; and 4) a dual power switch recall \u2013 addressed in September 2009. All recalls on the District vehicle were addressed. It is the intent of the District and Board of Education to provide safe and responsible transportation to and from school, extracurricular events, field trips, and all scheduled school activities. The safety and welfare of student riders is first consideration in all matters pertaining to transportation. We strive to ensure all vehicles used to transport students are maintained in such condition as to provide safe and efficient transportation service with a minimum of delays and disruptions of such service due to mechanical or equipment failure. Our school buses are inspected regularly in accordance with guidelines established by the Department of Transportation. At this point, the District is not aware of what caused the electrical power loss on February 6, 2014 and have taken the vehicle in for service to check into the matter further. We applaud the efforts of Mr. Bob Welsh and his utilization of safe driving skills to ensure student safety when the unexpected event did arise.\n\nUpdate - Wauzeka, WI, February 21, 2014 \u2013 Midwest News has learned that the loss of electrical power in the Wauzeka-Steuben school bus on February 6th may not have been a freak occurrence. Our research found that certain models of Thomas school buses were recalled for a defect in power switches that resulted in complete loss of electrical power, identical to what happened to Mr. Welsh.\n\nOver 17,000 Thomas school buses were recalled in December, 2008 for defective power switches. The recall notice reads in part, \u201cSolid state circuit breakers may trip unnecessarily potentially resulting in a loss of power to the bus chassis and body electrical circuits causing an unexpected loss of engine power and exterior lighting. Unexpected loss of engine power and exterior lighting could result in a vehicle crash [emphasis added]. Dealers will replace the solid state dual power switch with a mechanical circuit production (mega fuse). The recall is expected to begin during February 2009.\u201d\n\nMidwest News contacted the school district to see if the bus Mr. Welsh was driving, on February 6th, might have been included in this recall, and if it was included, was the recall fix completed. District Administrator Dr. Michael Garrow was cooperative, instructing Mr. Peter Pomerening, the transportation manager, to release the information. However, after five days of repeated calls to Mr. Pomerening he continues to refuse to release the information.\n\nHad Mr. Welsh's school bus been a half mile further along that steep, twisty Mill road when he lost brakes and steering, the outcome might have been far different. People have a right to know that their kids are riding in buses that have been kept up-to-date with all safety recalls. Midwest News will continue to seek the needed information; year, make, and model of the bus, the cause of the electrical failure, if known, and the recall record of this bus.\n\nWauzeka, WI - February 14, 2014 - Picture yourself driving a school bus heading down a steep and very twisty road when the engine quits, taking with it your power brakes and steering. You stand on the brakes, pull on the emergency brake, but the bus still picks up speed. This is what happened to Bob Welsh of Wauzeka, WI last Thursday, February 6th. Listen while Bob tells us in his own words, what happened.\n\nWhat went wrong with the bus? Good question. The school district would not comment.

(Cartoon by Sandy Collins) Millville home burns, no injuries On Saturday March 8, 2014 at 12:30pm the Guttenberg Fire Department was dispatched to 2530 South Main Street in Millville. Upon arrival of the first fire personnel it was determined to be a working structure fire in a two story home.\n\nFirst reports from fire personnel were that fire had broken through the roof of the structure. The fire department began a defensive fire attack on the structure to protect surrounding structures and contain the fire to the initial home. After an initial investigation the cause of the fire was undetermined. Because of the extent of damage to the structure a formal investigation did not yield any additional information. The structure was too unsafe to enter and find a cause or point of origin. At this time there are no immediate signs that the fire was intentional and is being ruled accidental. Later in the evening the fire department returned to the scene to extinguish hot spots. The fire department remained on scene until all visible fire sources where contained to the best of our ability. Fortunately the owner, Joan Wacker, was out of the structure when the fire department arrived and there are no reported injuries. The Tri State Chapter of the American Red Cross responded to the scene to assist. The Guttenberg Fire Department was assisted by the New Vienna/Luxemburg Fire Department, Holy Cross Fire Department, Colesburg Fire Department, Guttenberg Ambulance, Guttenberg Police Department, Clayton County Sheriff\u2019s Department, and American Red Cross.

The man in question was not masked, but had his face partially covered. The person in question was known to the elderly woman. He was a suspect in an earlier robbery where a gun was stolen, therefore the police felt he might be armed. Sheriff McCullick stressed that there is no danger to the community.\n\n\n\nRural Boscobel, WI - March 19, 2014 - A call went out about a man trying to break into a rural farm house at approx. 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday. An elderly woman stated somebody was trying to break down her door, the person had a mask on, and may have been armed. Crawford County Sheriff\u2019s Deputies and Boscobel Police descended on Pleasant Ridge Road just off of Plainview Ridge Road (I misspoke in the video).\n\nA K-9 unit was used in the search with perhaps a dozen police officers who scoured the countryside and near by farms and out buildings looking for the gunman. No one was found however neighbors were cautioned to keep their doors locked and to be aware of any strangers in the area. See video of the search.\n\nVideo viewing tips: Until we get high speed access, the best way to enjoy these videos is to start it, then put it on pause, so the buffer can load.

The investigation resulted in the arrest of Nathan Allbee, age 21 of Hazel Green, for two counts of disorderly conduct for his behavior on campus. The deputy and officer conducted several interviews and determined that Mr. Allbee had made threats to shoot up the campus to a couple of other students. Based on this information, Mr. Allbee was placed under arrest and transported to the Grant County Jail. Mr. Allbee was also barred from the campus by the administrative staff of Southwest Technical College and will not be allowed back in the future. Charges will be referred to the Grant County District Attorney\u2019s office for two counts of Disorderly Conduct and Mr. Allbee remains in custody at the Grant County Jail. Frankville fire destroys towns only business Frankville, Iowa - March 25, 2014 - Last night at approx. 10:16 p.m. shortly after The Old Store bar & grill closed, a fire broke out in the rear of the store. Frankville Fire Chief Monty\n\nWilder said that the building was fully engulfed when they arrived on scene. Black ice formed due to the cold night which gave firemen another challenge to deal with. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined.\n\nChief Wilder mentioned how thankful they were to have the assistance of fire departments from Castalia, Ossian, Postville, and Decorah along with Winneshiek Sheriff\u2019s Dept. and Alliant Energy.\n\nThe Old Store was the only gathering place in this small town, the last business. It\u2019s loss will surely be missed. Photo & video courtesy of Darrel Crawford.

Meanwhile, police in Phoenix arrested a father on suspicion of first-degree murder. Authorities said they believe he killed his 13-year-old son with an ax on Tuesday.\n\nThe tragic deaths combined to send the Valley violently into the new year.\n\nThe scene in Tolleson was discovered by a teenager who visited the home of relatives on Wednesday morning and found a man and his 6- and 8-year-old daughters dead inside.\n\nTwo men who were working at a nearby church and food bank said they knew that something awful had happened, and that it was too late to help when they spotted the teenager on the front porch, wailing in agony.\n\n\u201cIt was terrified screaming. She was screaming in Spanish, over and over again,\u201d said Steve Haltom, who works at the Bridge Community Church and Tolleson Food Bank.\n\nDennis Sims, who also works at the food bank, said he wished there was something he could have done to help the teen. He said an older woman quickly arrived and appeared to take control.\n\n\u201cPeople were devastated by what happened,\u201d Sims said.\n\nTolleson police were called at about 10 a.m. Wednesday and found the bodies.\n\nAuthorities obtained a search warrant after a delay of several hours because of difficulties in locating a judge on New Year\u2019s Day, according to Sgt. Obed Gaytan, a Tolleson police spokesman.\n\nHe said detectives concluded that Alejandro Gallardo, 45, shot his daughters to death before turning a handgun on himself. Gallardo shot himself in the head, and the gun was found near his body, Gaytan said. The names of the girls were not released.\n\n\u201cThat is the grand question: Why?\u201d Gaytan said.\n\nHe said the timing was jarring, with police having the sad duty of notifying relatives who arrived at the scene.\n\n\u201cIt is very somber,\u201d Gaytan said. \u201cThis is a time when we should be rejoicing with our family. It\u2019s sad this sort of incident happened.\u201d\n\nNeighbors said that there had been arguments between Gallardo and his girlfriend, the children\u2019s mother, and that their relationship was breaking apart.\n\nThe neighbors grieved the children\u2019s deaths.\n\n\u201cI just saw them out here playing (on Tuesday),\u201d neighbor Cynthia Echeverria said. \u201cTo hear about what happened today was mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nMaria Garza, another neighbor, broke into tears when she heard the news and said through an interpreter that the slain children had played with her children on Tuesday night.\n\nNeighbor Guadalupe Medina said Gallardo was a nice guy who invited neighbors to parties and worked at a nearby warehouse that packages carrots. She said Gallardo had told people that he planned to kill himself because the relationship with his girlfriend was broken but that no one took his statement seriously.\n\nGary Sherrill\n\n\u201cHe never said that he was going to do that to the little girls,\u201d Medina said. \u201cI think he loved them a lot, so he took them with him.\u201d\n\nThe Tolleson slayings followed the death of David Sherrill, 13, in Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice arrested his father, Gary Sherrill, 51, on suspicion of first-degree murder, said Sgt. Steve Martos, a Phoenix police spokesman.\n\nThe father told police he was afraid of his son.\n\n\u201c(He) stated he was scared of his son and believed his son was a demon and was going to eat him,\u201d Martos said.\n\nDavid\u2019s mother asked police to check on her son on Tuesday because her ex-husband was late returning the teen and she hadn\u2019t been able to reach either of them, Martos said.\n\nAt about 3:45 p.m. Tuesday, police conducted a welfare check on Gary Sherrill\u2019s residence, in the 6000 block of North 10th Place, Martos said.\n\nSherrill at first told officers that his son wasn\u2019t home, but officers prodded him into inviting them inside.\n\n\u201cOnce inside, they located the 13-year-old male victim, David Sherrill, deceased with obvious signs of trauma,\u201d Martos said. \u201cSadly, the victim sustained stab wounds and lacerations to several parts of his body.\u201d", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Javier Reveles, a 50-year-old Latino male, died Tuesday, Jan. 7, after being shot in Willowbrook, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.\n\nJavier Reveles Willowbrook\n\nCompton Avenue & East 117th Street\n\nAge: 50\n\nGender: Male\n\nCause: Gunshot\n\nRace/Ethnicity: Latino\n\nAgency: LASD\n\nDo you have information to share about the life of Javier Reveles?

Paramedics came to the scene to treat his injury.\n\nWhile this was going on, another call to the sheriff's office reported a prowler near the 400 building of the same apartment complex. Deputies went to the scene and found a 24-year-old Tarrant man who was bleeding from the head.\n\nThat man told deputies he had been with Roman at a mutual friend's house in North Birmingham, and Roman had asked for a ride to a nearby convenience store. On the way to the store, Roman pulled a gun and demanded money and heroin.\n\nWhen the man told Roman he had neither, Roman hit him in the head with the pistol and made him take off his pants.

He was at Candy Mountain Apartments, and started going door to door searching for someone to help him.\n\nDeputies charged Roman with first-degree kidnapping, first-degree assault and attempting to elude. He was taken to a local hospital to have his leg wound treated, and then was taken to the Jefferson County Jail.\n\nDuring questioning, Roman admitted he accidentally shot himself. He remains in the Jefferson County Jail with bond set at $126,000.\n\n\"Lets' see, he didn't get what he was after, he got caught, and he shot himself accidentally,'' Christian said. \" I would say he had a pretty bad day.

That month also had the third-highest monthly number of nonfatal shootings \u2014 78 \u2014 since the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission began keeping those records in 2006.\n\nThe violence spilled over into September, when 14 more homicides were recorded.\n\nThe 2013 homicide data is preliminary, and numbers could fluctuate because several death investigations are continuing. The Milwaukee Police Department follows the FBI's national crime reporting standards, which use the date of an individual's death in crime statistics and do not include homicides ruled self-defense.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Milwaukee regularly had more than 100 homicides a year, with a high of 165 such deaths in 1991, according to those FBI standards. That pattern dropped significantly starting in 2008, the year Flynn took office.\n\nThere have been four shootings since midday Tuesday that didn't involve life-threatening injuries.

Fernandez also pleaded no contest last week to the charge of driving on a suspended license.\n\nOn April 20th, 2014, when Lee County deputies stopped Fernandez for an alleged traffic violation in Fort Myers Beach, they detected the scent of marijuana wafting out of his car. Then, when a deputy instructed Fernandez to step out of his vehicle, a loaded handgun fell of his pocket. Deputies searched Fernandez and found the marijuana and Alprazolam, the drug commonly known as Xanax, in his shorts.\n\nFernandez testified on Friday in his own defense. On the stand, he admitted to possessing the marijuana and prescription pills, but he denied that there was ever a weapon in his shorts. He argued that the arresting deputy, who found the handgun at Fernandez's feet, was incorrect in assuming that the handgun must have come from Fernandez.\n\nAfter two and a half days of trial, the six-member jury deliberated for about an hour. Fernandez was remanded into custody until his sentencing date in September. He faces up to 15 years in prison. Fernandez's attorney, James Stanton, declined to give his reaction to Tuesday's guilty verdict.\n\n\"I'm going to reserve any and all comments until after the sentencing,\" Stanton said.\n\nProsecutor Brenda Wade also declined to comment.\n\nChristopher Corey (Photo: Submitted)\n\nIt remains uncertain if Fernandez will face charges in the Collier County killing. Fernandez has long been a named suspect in the killing of former Marine Christopher Corey in the Naples Manor section of East Naples, but Fernandez has never been charged. On January 20, 2014, Corey was at his home on Holland Street when two men burst inside around 3 a.m. and shot Corey and his two dogs.\n\nMichelle Batten, a spokesperson in the Collier County Sheriff's Office, would say only that, \"I believe it's still an active investigation.\"\n\nFernandez's attorney said he was not aware of the Collier County case.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the News Alerts newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Get alerted to the latest stories to stay on top of the news.

Morris had been charged with first degree murder, but his trial ended in a hung jury, and prosecutors offered him the manslaughter plea in order to avoid a re-trial that would have been emotionally difficult for Corey's family. Morris is now serving a 17-year prison sentence.\n\nA co-conspirator in the killing, Mallory McCann, was inside Corey\u2019s residence when the two men broke into the house. She had sent text messages to Fernandez at 3 a.m. to let him know the home\u2019s front door was unlocked, according to evidence at Morris' trial. McCann is now serving a 15-year prison sentence after a January plea agreement on robbery with a firearm.\n\nMcCann testified at Morris' trial, saying that Morris and Fernandez planned to steal drugs and money from Corey. McCann testified that she heard Morris and Fernandez discussing later how Fernandez had carried out the shooting.\n\nIn February 2014, Fernandez told a Naples Daily News reporter via Facebook that was not involved in the killing.\n\n\"Of the mistakes I have made, I had nothing to do with the murder of a Marine and his dog,\" wrote Fernandez.\n\nAt least one Collier County detective sat in the courtroom to observe Fernandez's weapons trial.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://nplsne.ws/2azKxRN", "publish_date": "2016-08-02"}, {"text": "TSA Week in Review: April 1 - 7 April 11, 2019 | 6 (# of comments) Winter is coming!

Bruce Ave. shortly after 8 a.m. after receiving a report of a naked person on the sidewalk. When officers arrived, they discovered the body of the woman whose coat had been torn off. They also found two male dogs who charged, prompting officers to shoot and kill the animals.\n\nFriday evening, the Montgomery County Coroner's Office identified the victim as Klonda S. Richey, 57. An autopsy is scheduled for Saturday morning.\n\nThe attack is believed to be the third fatal incident in 17 months in Montgomery County involving dogs and people.\n\nRichey worked for the county for 25 years. An employee with the Montgomery County Job & Family Services' Administrative Services Division, she worked at the Haines Children's Center on North Main Street. In the wake of Friday's attack, Montgomery County Animal Control Resource Center officers removed 20 cats, which were well cared for, from Richey's home.\n\nComplaints about the dogs had been made before. According to Mark Kumpf, Animal Resource Center director, there were nine earlier complaints about the dogs. The Dayton Daily News and News Center 7 requested the public records, but they were not available Friday.\n\nFollowing the attack, police took Andrew Nason, 28, and Julie Custer, 25, into custody while executing a search warrant at 35 E. Bruce Ave., the home next door to the victim's. Nason and Custer each are being held on a charge of reckless homicide, pending the filing of formal charges.\n\nKumpf described the dogs as mixed-Mastiff breeds and believes each of the dogs weighed up to 60 pounds. It is unclear what the mix of the dogs is but Kumpf said he believes they are part Cane Corso.\n\nA search of county dog license owners shows there are three dogs licensed and living in the same block as the victim. Two of those dogs, described as mixed breeds -- one tan, one red -- belong to Custer.\n\nIt is believed that the county has had three deaths related to dog attacks since 2001, according to Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County Coroner's Office. Two of those attacks occurred in separate incidents in 2012 and involved the deaths of a 76-year-old woman mauled by a Cane Corso and a 93-year-old female mauled by a Boston terrier. The third death occurred in 2001 after a 3-day-old boy was mauled by a German shepherd.\n\nThe coroner's office, in its records, does not list \"dog bite\" as a cause of death, Betz said.\n\nThe state does not keep track of dog bite-related fatalities, said Joanne Midla, public health veterinarian for the Ohio Department of Health. Nationally, the number of dog bite-related fatalities has ranged from 31 to 34 during the last five years, according to the National Canine Research Council.\n\nKumpf said any large breed dog has the potential to seriously injure or kill a person.\n\n\"Anybody who encounters a dog that they're not familiar with should try and back away from the situation,\" Kumpf said. \"If they are not able to do so, one of the things that we recommend is that they make themselves a smaller target as possible.\"\n\nNews Center 7 Reporter John Bedell contributed to this report.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "A man was shot in the leg Friday night in Baltimore's Midtown-Edmondson neighborhood.\n\nBaltimore Police Det.

He expressed a \"general hatred toward others,\" police said.\n\nThe details offered the most complete account to date of Aguilar's mental state in the period leading up to Saturday's shooting outside the Zumiez skate shop. His shotgun blasts killed Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, before he took his own life. Authorities say they know of no motive for the shooting.\n\nHoward County police provided additional information Wednesday on Aguilar's movements Saturday, authorizing the release of a missing-persons report filed by his mother that shows he left his College Park home on foot at 5:15 a.m.\n\nAnd police confirmed that Aguilar assembled his shotgun in a rear dressing room of the store before emerging and opening fire.\n\n\"We are moving forward in the investigation and gathering new details every day,\" police said in a statement. \"Like everyone else, we want to understand why this tragedy happened. We are looking for answers, not only for the investigation, but for the victims' families and for our community.\"\n\nIn the journal, police said, Aguilar talks about killing people in \"general terms,\" without referring to the victims or any specific person or location. Aguilar also mentions using marijuana, police said.\n\nWhen Aguilar left his College Park home on foot, he was wearing a gray beanie, gray hoodie, and blue jeans. He was set to open a Dunkin' Donuts store on U.S. 1, where he had been working, according to a police report from Prince George's County.\n\nHe never arrived to work, the report says. His mother contacted Prince George's police about 1:40 p.m., after Aguilar had taken his own life but before it was known that he was the shooter. That's when officers first viewed the journal, which Howard County police later had to obtain a search warrant to further explore.\n\nThat leaves a gulf of about five hours between when Aguilar left his home and when police say he arrived at The Mall in Columbia via taxi, at about 10:15 a.m. The cab company, Barwood Taxi, confirmed Wednesday that one of their drivers had taken Aguilar to the mall, but would not say where he was picked up. The company serves Montgomery County.\n\nHoward County police say Aguilar lingered in the food court area before carrying out the shooting on the second floor at the Zumiez store around 11:15 a.m.\n\nBenlolo, of College Park, and Johnson, of Mount Airy, were shot inside the store, police said. The medical examiner's office said Benlolo was shot once in the attack, suffering fatal wounds to her neck and chest. Johnson was shot multiple times, according to the medical examiner.\n\nPolice have also said they found and disarmed crude explosive devices in Aguilar's bag.\n\nWith no connections unearthed by investigators, it remains unclear whether Aguilar targeted the store or its employees. But police say he continued shooting.\n\nOutside of the store, Aguilar fired a shot that hit a 49-year-old Hanover woman in the foot. He sent another blast into the downstairs food court, police confirmed.\n\nWitnesses on the first floor have previously said Aguilar fired downward. Shafon Robinson, who was in the food court, said Saturday that \"he looked straight at me. \u2026 He pointed the gun at me and looked at my eyes.\"\n\nThe woman who was shot in the foot declined to be interviewed after she parked an SUV in her driveway Wednesday evening and walked into her garage showing a slight limp. She asked not to be identified because she is a victim of a crime.\n\nAguilar graduated last summer from James Hubert Blake High School in Silver Spring, and enrolled in Montgomery Community College but did not attend. He was born in Denver, his parents separated in 1999, and in late October his mother filed for his divorce from his father, court records show.\n\nAguilar purchased the shotgun in mid-December at a Rockville gun shop. The gun store owner said in an interview that Aguilar was friendly, paid for the $430 pump-action shotgun with cash, and said he planned to use it in his home for protection.\n\nOn Tuesday, police said they had learned that Aguilar, described by friends as a skateboarder, frequented the mall and hung around outside, smoking cigarettes with small groups of people.\n\nQuy Le Vo, a co-worker of Benlolo and Johnson at the Zumiez store, said he had seen Aguilar in the store before the shooting, though he couldn't remember how many times or when.\n\n\"I've seen him with his friends,\" he said. \"That's about it.\"\n\nAguilar was just a shopper, like scores of other people he had seen during his time working at the retail store. \"People come and go,\" Vo said.\n\nVo, 19, said he was not aware of Benlolo or Johnson being familiar with Aguilar.\n\nNothing he knew, he said, gave him any forewarning or suspicion that a gunman would attack Zumiez. Vo was not working at the time of the attack.\n\n\"Brianna was a close friend of mine,\" he said from the door of his Silver Spring home. \"If I knew, I would've helped out. I basically woke up to a nightmare.\"\n\nThe storefront in The Mall in Columbia has remained closed even after the shopping center reopened for business Monday. A sign at a Zumiez store in Waldorf announced an early closing Wednesday, as staff met in private to honor Benlolo and Johnson.\n\nBaltimore Sun reporter Nayana Davis contributed to this article.\n\njfenton@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/justin_fenton\n\njgeorge@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/justingeorge\n\n\n\n", "publish_date": "2014-01-29"}, {"text": "TSA Week in Review: April 1 - 7 April 11, 2019 | 6 (# of comments) Winter is coming!

Cerritos, 25, of Paxton, Evigan J. Marcos, 24, of Loda and Eduardo Samano, 22, of Berwyn with one count each of armed robbery, a Class X felony; kidnapping, a Class 2 felony; and aggravated battery, a Class 3 felony.\n\nCerritos and Marcos remained at the Ford County Jail on Thursday, while Paxton Police Chief Bob Bane said he was notified that as of 9 a.m. Samano was in the custody of Berwyn police.\n\nBond is set at $250,000 for Samano, and Fitton said he has asked Judge Paul Lawrence to set the same bond amount for Cerritos and Marcos. Preliminary hearings have not been set.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint from Paxton police filed in court, the victim reported to police that on Dec. 9, he was abducted by two Hispanic men \u2014 later identified as Marcos and Cerritos \u2014 as he was leaving the business where he works in Paxton. The kidnappers used a pistol and a baseball bat to force him into a vehicle by \"hitting him in the head multiple times,\" the complaint said.\n\nThey then drove around Ford and Iroquois counties threatening to kill him and his family.\n\n\"The gentleman was held for hours, beaten and extorted for money,\" Bane said.\n\n\"During this time, they struck (the victim) with the bat and pistol,\" police said in the complaint. \"They stuck a gun to (his) head and dry-fired the pistol twice.\"\n\nThe kidnappers agreed to let the victim leave if he provided $800 in cash to them the following day by dropping it in a garbage can at the park in Loda. They had already allegedly robbed him of $300, several credit cards, a cellphone, two checks totaling $8,000, a GPS unit and external computer hard drive.\n\nSamano, who was not in the vehicle throughout the incident but allegedly \"set everything up,\" later picked up Cerritos and Marcos \"from the scene,\" the complaint said.\n\nPaxton police asked for the FBI's assistance in investigating the incident. On Wednesday, the victim was asked to leave $50,000 in the same garbage can at the park, and the FBI \"covered\" the funds, the complaint said. Cerritos then collected it from the park on Wednesday, the complaint said.\n\nCerritos was arrested by Paxton police, FBI agents and state police during a traffic stop in the 200 block of North Market Street on Wednesday, Bane said. The complaint said Cerritos confessed to his involvement and named Samano and Marcos as others involved, adding that Samano \"planned everything.\"\n\nMarcos was arrested later Wednesday by Paxton police, FBI agents and state police at his home in the 200 block of South Elm Street in Loda.\n\nPolice then obtained an arrest warrant for Samano late Wednesday night, and he was arrested Thursday morning in Berwyn by Berwyn police and the U.S. Marshal Service. The Ford County Sheriff's Office was expected to pick him up for transfer to the Ford County Jail later Thursday.\n\nIf convicted, all three men face a potential sentence of six to 30 years in prison for the most serious of the charges, the Class X felony.\n\nBane said Cerritos was charged additionally with driving on a revoked license and possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nIn addition to the FBI's Champaign office and Illinois State Police, Bane said, Paxton police were assisted by the Iroquois County Sheriff's Office, the Ford County Sheriff's Office and the Gibson City Police Department.", "publish_date": "2014-01-16"}, {"text": "The Justice Department on Thursday is expected to release a redacted version of the special counsel's report on Russian election interference and the Trump campaign, opening up months, if not years, of fights over what the document means in a deeply divided country.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Norfolk, VA (23510)\n\nToday\n\nMostly cloudy skies early, then partly cloudy in the afternoon.

Olson announced. Sentencing is set for June 10, 2015, before U.S. District Judge Edward J. Lodge.\n\nAccording to court documents, on January 10, 2014, Annable and his co-defendant Nathan Paul Davenport, aiding and abetting each other, broke into and stole cash from an automated teller machine (ATM) located at the Idaho First Bank in McCall, Idaho. The indictment alleges that Davenport possessed, carried, used, and discharged a firearm, specifically a Ruger semiautomatic rifle, in connection with the offense. Davenport admitted that he used the rifle to shoot at pursuing McCall police officers. Annable was aware that Davenport shot at pursuing officers because Davenport and Annable communicated over an open cell phone connection during the larceny. During Davenport\u2019s heist from the ATM, Annable drove about nearby waiting to pick up Davenport in an escape vehicle. As part of the conspiracy, the indictment charged both men with other ATM larcenies committed against Idaho Banking Company in Boise and Meridian on January 5, 2014, and a string of ATM larcenies in December, 2013 and January, 2014, which occurred in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, as well as in Idaho.\n\nDavenport pleaded guilty on March 30, 2015, to bank larceny by use of a dangerous weapon, use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony crime, and conspiracy to commit bank larceny. He will be sentenced on June 22, 2015.\n\nAnnable and Davenport were arrested without incident on January 12, 2014, in Orem, Utah, in connection with a separate ATM robbery in Wyoming. The two men were in custody on the Wyoming charges prior to being transported to Boise on the Idaho charges. In the District of Wyoming, both men pleaded guilty to single counts of ATM theft and aiding and abetting and each received a fourteen month prison sentence.\n\nThe charge of bank larceny by use of a dangerous weapon as charged in the Idaho indictment is punishable by up to 25 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to five years of supervised release. The charge of conspiracy to commit bank larceny is punishable by up to five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to three years\u2019 supervised release.\n\nThe case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho State Police, the Valley County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the McCall Police Department.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "FOX 32 Chicago streams live daily.

Late Tuesday the Alameda County Coroner\u2019s office confirmed that he was 42-year-old Sgt. Tom Smith Jr., a 20-year law enforcement veteran.\n\n\u201cThis is a shocking thing for a BART officer to be killed in the line of duty,\u201d said elected BART Director Gail Murray, of Walnut Creek. \u201cBut like all peace officers, our BART police risk their lives when they go out to work in the stations and cities. We feel very saddened for the family, who would not expect (this to) happen to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nAround 2 p.m. Tuesday, a group of four members of BART\u2019s detective unit and several members of Dublin Police and Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s departments, converged on the Park Sierra Apartments, at 6450 Dougherty Road. Wearing bulletproof vests, the group were there to search of an apartment belonging a suspect in several robberies on BART property, authorities said.\n\nThe suspect, whom officials did not name, was already in custody and was not inside the apartment at the time, according to Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is leading the investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe officers began their search by knocking twice on the door. Each knock went unanswered, but the door was unlocked, so several of them stepped inside, Nelson said.\n\nNot knowing whether anyone was inside the apartment, the officers followed protocol and entered with their guns drawn, Nelson said.\n\nThe details of what happened next have not been released, but Nelson said that once inside the apartment, one of the officers fired a single shot from his weapon, wounding Smith, who later died at Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley.\n\nThe name of the BART officer who fired the shot was not released. Nelson said that officer had been in law enforcement for more than 10 years.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I have to announce the tragic loss of the first BART officer killed in the line of duty,\u201d BART police Chief Kenton Rainey said Tuesday evening at the hospital. \u201cWe ask everyone to give us a chance to catch our breath.\u201d\n\nAt the hospital, Rainey and BART General Manager Grace Crunican met with Smith\u2019s family. BART officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies saluted as a gurney was rolled out of the hospital with an American flag draping the body, before it was put into a coroner\u2019s van and taken away, flanked by about 10 law enforcement officers on motorcycles.\n\nThe shooting rattled residents of the sprawling apartment complex in the East Bay suburb. Rosalia Vazquez, who lives several doors down from where the shooting occurred inside the Park Sierra Apartments, said she wasn\u2019t home at the time. But she knew when she arrived home that something had happened because the apartment door was barricaded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet usually. It\u2019s the reason I moved here,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cI\u2019m just in shock. I can\u2019t imagine this happening.\u201d\n\nThe death marked the 36th on-duty officer killed by accidental gunfire in California since 1895. The last time a police officer in Alameda County was killed by another officer was in January 2001, when two Oakland police officers shot and killed an undercover detective.\n\nOfficer William Wilkins was pursing an auto thief near 89th Avenue when Officers Andrew Koponen and Timothy Scarrott arrived as Wilkins drew his weapon on the suspect. Both officers fired several times, killing Wilkins, after they said he ignored orders to drop the weapon.\n\nThe shooting was the latest challenge for the BART system and its police force. Jan. 1 marked five years since BART police officer Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, who was being detained on a platform at the Fruitvale station.\n\nMore recently, the system was shut down by failed contract negotiations that led to strikes that stranded hundreds of thousands of Bay Area commuters in July and October. Two workers were killed during the October strike, when they were struck by a train on its way to a maintenance yard as they performed track inspections in Walnut Creek.\n\nStaff writers Denis Cuff, Lisa Vorderbreuggen, Thomas Peele and Matt O\u2019Brien contributed to this report.", "publish_date": "2014-01-21"}, {"text": "You are the owner of this article.", "publish_date": "2014-01-30"}, {"text": "Reporter\n\nMike Connors covers education for The Virginian-Pilot.

In a letter sent April 10 to the Director of National Intelligence, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) - who have led Republican efforts to investigate the Russia investigators - asked for quicker action to declassify 53 interview transcripts done by the House Intelligence Committee. 'As the Justice Department prepares the Special Counsel's report for public disclosure, full transparency demands the public disclosure of (the panel's) witness interviews on the same subject matter,' the two Republicans wrote. The GOP pressure to publicly release more interview transcripts comes as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), has been slowly releasing individual transcripts of interviews done by Congress in 2018. 'I am committed to making sure the American people understand what went on in the investigation of the FBI and the Department of Justice,' Collins said as he released the second part of an interview with the former General Counsel of the FBI. 'Transparency matters. We will continue to release these transcripts,' Collins added, as Republicans have cheered the unilateral moves. So far, Collins has released closed door interview transcripts with a group of very familiar names from the FBI and Justice Department who were involved in the Russia investigation: DOJ official Bruce Ohr, his wife Nellie Ohr, who worked on Russian research for the group Fusion GPS, which was bankrolling the author of the Steele Dossier, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, FBI counterintelligence head Peter Strzok, FBI legal counsel Jim Baker and top FBI counterintelligence official Bill Priestap. What have the details of those interviews shown? Like a lot of things in Washington, D.C., it depends what side of the ball you're on. 1. The idea of Russian interference alarmed FBI/DOJ officials. One theme which is readily apparent from all of the transcripts released so far is that law enforcement officials felt the possibility of Russian interference in the 2016 elections - and the chance that of possible Russian ties to members of the Trump campaign, or people tied to President Trump - clearly merited investigation. 'Extremely serious,' said ex-FBI General Counsel Jim Baker, as the threat of Russia obviously worried officials. 'It doesn't get much more serious or grave than that,' said Peter Strzok. 'And if there is somebody on his team who wittingly or unwittingly is working with the Russians, that is super serious,' said FBI lawyer Lisa Page. 'I was very concerned,' said Bruce Ohr. 2. Republicans question Steele; FBI stands behind him. For Republicans, there is little in the way of credibility attached to former British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele, as they see him peddling false information to the FBI, which spurred an investigation of President Trump. But it's very clear FBI and DOJ officials are on the other side of that coin. 'I think any attempt by a foreign power to gain influence over a Presidential campaign would be troubling,' said Bruce Ohr, who met with Steele multiple times, and turned materials over to the FBI for him - warning them who Steele was working for. 'I wanted them to be aware of any possible bias,' Ohr testified. Lisa Page testified that the FBI ran the traps immediately on Steele's information. 'And to the best of my knowledge, we were never able to disprove any statement in it,' she said. 3. FBI/DOJ: We didn't leak about the Russia investigation. As Republicans used these interviews to accuse various officials of conducting a biased investigation against President Trump, one counterpoint comes up repeatedly - the feds never leaked the existence of the Trump investigation during the 2016 campaign, knowing full well it could have been lethal for the President's bid for the White House. 'That would have been improper,' said Peter Strzok, who speculated that a leak about the Russia probe would have had an 'adverse impact' on the President's chances. 'That's not how the FBI operates,' said Lisa Page, who said, 'we all had had and still have incredibly damning information which could have been released.' And there was one more point. 'The answer is no, I am not aware of an effort to put a spy in the campaign,' said Jim Baker. 4. GOP lawmakers press repeatedly for info on Steele Dossier. From the transcripts, GOP lawmakers clearly believe that the Steele Dossier was given much too much importance by the FBI. Lisa Page said she first read parts of the dossier in mid-to-late September 2016. Republicans claimed the CIA had the dossier in August. 'Totally surprises me,' Page said when told that by GOP lawmakers. 'As of August of 2016, I don't know who Christopher Steele is,' Page added. Some officials testified about how they were given the Steele Dossier - but not by Steele; Jim Baker received it from reporter David Corn. 'I know that David was anxious to get this into the hands of FBI,' Baker said. 'And being the person at the FBI that he knew the best, he wanted to give it to me.' Bruce Ohr said Steele kept after him to get information to the FBI, because he felt like U.S. officials weren't heeding his warnings about Trump-Russia connections. 'I think he was very alarmed by the information that he had provided to me about contacts between the Russian Government and the Donald Trump campaign,' Ohr said of Steele, who warned that Russia 'had Trump over a barrel.' 5. A growing alarm within the FBI over Trump-Russia ties. The transcripts show that as Election Day neared in 2016, top officials were getting increasingly worried about what they were seeing in terms of the Russia investigation. 'I grew more alarmed over time,' said ex-FBI Counsel Jim Baker. Peter Strzok said, 'the menace that I saw was primarily the interference of the Government of Russia in the Presidential elections.' And the fact that Russia was involved made it more explosive - Lisa Page called Moscow, 'our most treacherous adversary.' But Page also had something very to interesting to say about the investigation and how it related to the candidate himself - 'at the time that we opened the investigation, I don't have any reason to believe that it is Donald Trump himself who was colluding with the Russians.' 6. GOP lawmakers frustrated by refusal to answer questions. The specter of the Mueller investigation hung over most of the proceedings in the transcripts which have been released so far, as various officials - backed by FBI legal counsel in the room - refused to answer questions which might touch on the Russia investigation. 'I'm not at liberty to talk about the topic,' Bill Priestap said. 'I can't answer that question at this time, sir,' said Lisa Page. 'I don't think it's appropriate for him to answer that question,' one lawyer said of a question to Bruce Ohr. 'I can't answer that question,' Peter Strzok said when asked about the Russia probe. 'It's answerable, but I, under advice of agency counsel, I can't answer that.' And then there were instances where the questions got into possible legal problems for the witness, like former FBI counsel Jim Baker. 'You're saying he's under criminal investigation?' asked Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC). 'That's why you're not letting him answer?' At some points, the frustration boiled over. 'So if Mr. Jordan asks the witness, 'Have you ever met Robert Mueller?' are you going to allow him to answer that question?' asked a frustrated Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). 7. Those working at the FBI really don't like the Russians. One theme from these interviews is a deep-seated belief at the FBI that Russian Intelligence is not sending flowers to the United States. 'I mean, most everybody who works counterintelligence at the FBI has pretty strong feelings about the Russian Federation,' Lisa Page told GOP lawmakers. 'Russia poses the most severe existential threat to Western democracy in the world,' she added. 'I think it is demonstrably true that a foreign nation clandestinely putting themselves into a Presidential election, it doesn't get much more serious or grave than that,' said Peter Strzok. 'If the Russian Government was attempting to influence the Trump campaign in some way, I would think that would be a national security threat,' said Bruce Ohr, whose focus had been on Russian organized crime. 8. Little detail on talk of wire or 25th Amendment. While Republican lawmakers were obviously alarmed by testimony that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had suggested wearing a wire to talk with the President - and/or invoking the 25th Amendment to move him out of office - top FBI officials made clear it was all talk. FBI Counsel Jim Baker said, \u201cit was just not something that made any sense to do.\u201d GOP lawmakers wanted to know what kind of review the FBI did on the ideas. The answer - nothing. \u201cTo my recollection, we didn't do any legal research or anything of that nature,\u201d said Baker. \u201cSo then what happened?\u201d asked Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). \u201cYou just dropped it, like, okay, no big deal?\u201d Baker's answer was the same - \u201cit just was one of these things that didn't make sense from a commonsense perspective.\u201d From the transcripts, it seems clear that both Jordan and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) clearly didn't believe that it had just been dropped - but no other evidence has surfaced so far to show that it was anything other than something mentioned by Rosenstein.

As soon as Gomez opened the passenger side door a young woman forced the door open, put a gun to her face and demanded her purse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the element of surprise,\u201d Gomez recalled. \u201cI guess I was panicked and I looked like I was trying to fight and she told me \u2018Don\u2019t fight me. Don\u2019t fight me!\u2019 and I was scared that the gun would go off.\u201d\n\nGomez did not have her purse with her and to prove it, she told the suspect she was going to turn on the light in their van so she could see for herself. When the light turned on, her 4-year-old grandson caught a glimpse of the suspect and the gun and began to cry.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Be quiet, baby. Be quiet, baby,\u2019 trying to calm him down,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nMeanwhile, a second suspect, a young male, threatened Gomez\u2019s husband with a knife. \u201cHe said, \u2018My partner got a gun on your wife, you need to hand over your wallet.\u2019\u201d\n\nGomez\u2019s husband complied with the robber\u2019s directions and the suspects ran and got into a light-colored SUV parked a few houses down.\n\nThe suspects got away with credit cards, a driver\u2019s license, passport and cash.\n\nWhile Gomez\u2019s priority is helping her grandson forget the incident, she hopes her story helps others become more aware of the potential danger lurking outside their own homes.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that one of these days, they may get desperate and shoot someone.\u201d\n\nSuspect descriptions vary in many of the robberies, so police don\u2019t think they are all connected.\n\nDallas police are urging residents to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times.

Eloy Gonzalez-Rocha was also charged with being a deported alien found in the United States.\n\nAccording to court documents, on January 8, 2014, Fresno County Sheriff deputies investigated complaints about a strong smell of marijuana and various activities at a property in Dunlap in Fresno County. They found the brothers, who are undocumented, in a rented mobile home on the property. After obtaining a search warrant, narcotics detectives found 260 marijuana plants, more than 200 pounds of processed marijuana, $15,160 in cash, and three firearms, one of which was reported stolen from Arkansas and another having an obliterated serial number.

Jones, 25, was convicted of attempted second-degree murder and three counts of illegal firearm possession on Wednesday (Aug. 26, 2015) by an Orleans Parish jury. Jones still faces a federal trial on juvenile sex trafficking charges set for Oct. 5.\n\n(Courtesy of Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office)\n\nAn accused Memphis pimp was convicted of attempted second-degree murder and three gun violations Wednesday (Aug. 26) after an Orleans Parish jury deliberated for about 90 minutes.\n\nBy an 11-1 vote, the jury found Timothy T. Jones guilty of attempting to murder a man shot twice in a Gentilly home in February 2014. As a repeat offender, Jones faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 4 by Criminal District Court Judge Karen Herman.\n\nJones, 25, is awaiting a federal jury trial scheduled for Oct. 5 to answer an eight-count indictment alleging interstate trafficking of juvenile girls for the purposes of sex and prostitution. Authorities allege that Jones drugged, beat and intimidated two girls age 16 and 17 to provide him income through prostitution.\n\nInvestigators described Jones as a pimp who also goes by the names \"Lucci,\" \"King Lucci\" and \"Lucci Loco.\"\n\nThe two-day trial was not without challenges for Orleans Parish prosecutors Taylor Anthony and Bonycle Thornton. The shooting victim, who was left without feeling in his lower extremities because of a bullet lodged in his spine, refused to testify against Jones. Prosecutors said the victim was another alleged pimp, who angered Jones by taking his clothing from a hotel room after Jones was arrested on weapons charges on Feb. 11, 2014.\n\nFederal agents and NOPD officers raided that hotel room in the 300 block of St. Joseph Street in the Warehouse District on Feb. 11, 2014, seeking to arrest Christopher Williams, a third alleged pimp who was wanted on sex trafficking and prostitution allegations.\n\nWhile searching for Williams, police said they found a pistol and an AK-47 rifle in the closet of a room registered to Jones. Because Jones had a previous felony robbery conviction in Tennessee, he was barred from possessing firearms and arrested on suspicion of illegal weapons possession.\n\nJones posted bond within days, but not before threatening the man who took his clothing in a recorded jailhouse call, prosecutors said. Six days after his arrest for weapons poession, Jones shot the victim at a home in the 2500 block of Gladiolus Street, police said.\n\nProsecutors said Jones fled back to Memphis after the shooting, violating terms of his bond on the New Orleans weapons arrests. Jones was captured in Tennessee and extradited back to Louisiana in April 2014.\n\nWhile jailed, Jones used a contraband phone to speak with Williams, admitting he shot the third pimp who made off with his clothes, prosecutors said. But when Williams was subpoenaed to testify Wednesday, he refused to utter a word from the witness stand. Judge Herman found Williams in contempt of court and sentenced him to six months in Orleans Parish Prison to run consecutive to his other sentences.\n\nJones was supposed to have gone on trial May 27. That date had to be reset after Jones was beaten and stabbed in the lower left side of his back inside Orleans Parish Prison on the night before jury selection was to begin. Herman granted a continuance after that attack at the request of Jones' attorney, Michael Idoyaga, and ordered jail officials \"to take whatever steps necessary to ensure (Jones') safety.\"", "publish_date": "2015-08-27"}, {"text": "If Iowa wants growth, an open border is not the answer\n\n\"The fact that some Iowa businesses rely on immigrant labor is irrelevant to the question of whether we should allow massive numbers of illegal aliens to cross our borders.\"", "publish_date": "2014-01-11"}, {"text": "The Philadelphia Police Department\u2019s East Detectives Division is looking to identify the suspect who robbed Ace Check Cashing in Franklinville.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, at 9:45 am, the complainant, a 27 year-old-female, was inside of the Ace Check Cashing located at 3509 Germantown Avenue when two unknown males wearing ski masks entered the store through the ceiling.

Mike Knack said investigators believe the April 2 shooting -- which resulted in the death of former high-school football standout Herman Groce III, 22 -- involved a dispute between members of two rival gangs.\n\nFive days after the shooting, the city filed a lawsuit in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in an attempt to close Shots Bar for one year.\n\nKnack said one of the rival gang members fatally shot Groce, who played at Cleveland Heights and Brush high schools. Knack said the gang affiliations of Groce and the suspected shooter played a role in the argument that led to the shooting.\n\nPolice found Groce, an All-Northeast Ohio Conference defensive back in 2009 for Brush, lying unconscious on the dance floor but still breathing. One officer saw a car leaving the bar and driving more than 100 miles per hour on Euclid Avenue. The officer reported losing sight of the car.\n\nWitnesses told police they heard a popping sound and some didn\u2019t realize it was gunshots until people started rushing toward the door.\n\nReports say one man ran outside behind a truck and fired several shots. Officers found bullet shell casings near the truck, which had bullet holes in the side. No arrests have been made and Knack said bar patrons have since refused to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nThe shooting led to two fights at a different bar two days later.\n\nThe fights broke out at Shillelagh\u2019s Bar in Cleveland Heights after a vigil in Groce\u2019s honor at Forrest Hills Park. Reports say surveillance video shows a large fight with about 10 people involved. One person can be seen on video kicking another man, who appeared to be knocked unconscious.\n\nDays after the shooting, Euclid city officials filed a lawsuit against Shots Bar, and its owner, Vonn Morgan of Cleveland. Court records say Morgan agreed to keep the bar closed until a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for April 30 in Judge Joseph Russo\u2019s courtroom.\n\nThe lawsuit says shootings, gambling and drug activity occurs regularly at the bar, detailing six incidents since Sept. 26 that shows the bar should be closed, including:\n\nMarch 29: Five to eight gunshots fired in a shootout. The gunshots were fired directly in front of the front door, according to the complaint.\n\nMarch 26: Five to six gunshots fired at the bar, two hours after a fight was reported.\n\nMarch 5: A possible smoke bomb was set off inside the bar. The lawsuit contends a fight broke out on the dance floor, and several men beat and stabbed a man outside the bar\u2019s front door, leaving a pool of blood.\n\nFeb. 19: A man dragged a 25-year-old woman from the bar and punched her in the face several times.

After days without sleep, he drove 18 hours from his condo in Seattle to his family\u2019s San Juan Capistrano home.\n\nThe testimony offered for the first time an account and possible motive in the fatal shootings of Bradford Sachs, 57, and Andra Sachs, 54, in the early hours of Feb. 9. Their 8-year-old son was also shot, leaving the boy paralyzed. In all, investigators recovered 24 cartridges from the gated home in the 32200 block of Peppertree Bend, an exclusive area of San Juan Capistrano.\n\nWeeks later, Ashton Sachs was arrested on suspicion of his parents\u2019 murders as well as the attempted murder of his little brother and one of his sisters. In an interview at Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department Headquarters, he told deputies he didn\u2019t have a specific reason for the killings, just a lifetime of problems, lead investigator Justin Montano testified.\n\nHis parents didn\u2019t trust him, Sachs told deputies, and they favored his other siblings, Montano said. They hadn\u2019t taken his suicide attempt a year earlier seriously, he said, and he blamed them for the horrible way he felt. Text messages recovered from Sachs\u2019 phone and quoted in the testimony include an exchange between him and his mother three days before the shooting, his father\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cYou forgot his birthday. Not nice,\u201d Andra Sachs wrote.\n\n\u201cI forgot his birthday just as much as he forgot he has a son,\u201d Ashton replied.\n\n\u201cWow, no he didn\u2019t. He loves you very much,\u201d his mother said.\n\nAshton told deputies he had bought a rifle, thinking he would kill himself, according to the testimony. After his decision to kill his parents first, he stayed up for four or five days straight, he told the deputies. Internet history on his phone showed Wikipedia articles on felony murder, attempted murder, the insanity defense and parole, an investigator testified.\n\nAfter the long drive from Seattle, he parked outside his parents\u2019 shop in San Juan Capistrano and sat in his car, a 2005 white Prius, for a few hours. Then, around 1:30 a.m., he drove to his family home and walked in through the unlocked front door.\n\nOnce inside, he wandered around upstairs for 10 or 15 minutes, he told deputies. Finally, he decided he had to act. He felt a rush; it was twisted, he told the deputies, according to Montano\u2019s testimony. He killed his parents first, he said, according to the testimony. As he walked past his little brother\u2019s room, he shot at the boy, leaving bullet holes in the bunk bed, investigators said. He also opened the door to his sister\u2019s room and shot once, he told deputies.\n\nHis sister told the grand jury the noise woke her, but she didn\u2019t see her attacker. She didn\u2019t get out of bed until she heard her younger brother crying for help upstairs. He couldn\u2019t feel his legs, he told her from the floor outside their parents\u2019 room. After she saw her parents, she ran to wake up her sister, who then called 911.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashton Sachs dropped off his car at his parents\u2019 shop, Montano testified. He made arrangements with an auto transport company to have his car shipped back to Seattle. A taxi took him to John Wayne Airport; he had bought a plane ticket on the drive down from Washington.\n\nBack home in Washington, Sachs was officially notified of his parents\u2019 deaths around noon.\n\nWith no sign of a break-in, the crime left investigators puzzled. In one early interview, Sachs suggested several people who had business dealings with his parents as possible suspects.\n\nThe break in the case, Montano told the grand jury, came after authorities received phone records from Ashton Sachs, which had been requested as a standard part of the investigation. The teen had told deputies he was home in Washington at the time of the killings. Based on the phone records, it appeared he was lying, Montano said.\n\nAuthorities would later find his car in the yard of the auto shipping company, the testimony said. Inside the trunk, a Seattle police sergeant found the rifle. Airline records and video also placed Sachs in Orange County, flying out of John Wayne Airport the day his parents were killed.\n\nConfronted with the evidence after his arrest, Sachs told deputies that he had felt useless, Montano testified. He had stopped going to school, his life was a mess and he blamed his parents.\n\nDeputies asked him if he knew what he was doing was wrong, according to the testimony.\n\nIt was, Sachs replied, according to Montano\u2019s testimony. He expected he would sit in a mental institution for a long time, or get the death penalty.\n\nSachs has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges. He is scheduled to be arraigned later this month on the criminal indictment that the grand jury issued.\n\nContact the writer: ckoerner@ocregister.com or 714-704-3706", "publish_date": "2014-07-09"}, {"text": "Advertisement Man faces 35 charges in quadruple shooting 4 dead in North Carrollton shooting, Lamont Jones arrested Share Shares Copy Link Copy\n\nBaltimore City police have arrested a man in a quadruple shooting last week in west Baltimore.Police Commissioner Anthony Batts is trying to send a message that neighborhoods willing to talk have his ear.Lamont Jones, 29, faces 35 criminal charges related to last Tuesday's shooting of four men in west Baltimore.

While the city is not quite on pace to break any annual homicide records, Police Chief James Barber said there are some obvious trends in 2014\u2019s cases.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\u201cThe big trend with homicide we\u2019ve seen lately is drug-related homicide,\u201d he said. \u201cMost homicides are between parties who are known to each other and often they are heat-of-the-moment, passion-type crimes \u2026 but we\u2019ve been challenged pretty heavily by the introduction of spice from an over-the-counter drug that went to street-level dealers.\u201d\n\nIn six of the 18 cases, including the two most recent, no arrests have been made, but Barber indicated some of those homicides may be related to more widespread criminal activity that is currently the subject of a larger investigation.\n\nHe singled out back-to-back murders on Next Street in May and several others in the vicinity of Webb Avenue as being particularly unusual.\n\n\u201cAll of them are in a nexus of spice-related criminal organizations, and that\u2019s an extensive operation because of the criminal organization involved,\u201d he said of the ongoing investigation. \u201cIt involves intelligence as well as the homicide unit.\u201d\n\nBarber spoke of taking an \u201coffender-oriented approach,\u201d to solving those murders, where the organizations are \u201cattacked\u201d by the department\u2019s intelligence to develop the information homicide needs in order to prosecute the suspects.\n\n\u201cThere are two main components of homicide and if you can figure out why it happened and how it happened, you can usually determine who did it,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have enough evidence to prosecute. You also have to rely on witness testimony, forensic evidence and statements from the defendant, if they are willing to provide them.\u201d\n\nExcept for three, all of Mobile\u2019s murder victims in 2014 have died from gunshot wounds. The exceptions were 19-year-old Tyrone Gable, who succumbed to blood loss after jumping through a glass window to escape a domestic altercation June 9, 23-month-old Christian Henderson, a toddler who appears to have been beaten and 23-year-old Quentavious Battiste, who was stabbed by his girlfriend.\n\nThe aggressor in the Gable case, 20-year-old Jimmie Lee Taite, was charged with felony murder even though he never directly attacked the victim.\n\n\u201cFrom a police standpoint, we see people with no criminal record at all commit homicide,\u201d Barber said, noting that Gable died while Taite was committing a breaking-and-entering and assault on another individual on the property.\n\nMobile reported a total of 27 homicides in 2013, which was down from a 10-year high of 42 in 2008. This year, five cases initially reported as homicide have been dismissed as justifiable, a number Barber said was \u201cextremely high.\u201d\n\n\u201cHomicide by definition merely means the killing of one human being by another and by itself is not a crime,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Justifiable\u2019 means that if you are trying to protect yourself from serious injury or death whereas unjustifiable are those with any malice or intent and those are called \u2018murder\u2019 under the criminal statute we use.\u201d\n\nBarber said any perceived \u201cuptick\u201d in the number of recent murders is the result of \u201cdisorganized, violent, inner-city crime,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t dismiss the cases as typical.\n\n\u201cI think there is every reason in the world to be alarmed,\u201d he said, repeating his talking point that spice could be as threatening to the community as crack cocaine was in the 1980s. Since then, \u201cwe have had a lot of success but now we have spice entering the scene and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing this large effort to stop it before it becomes an epidemic.\u201d\n\n2014 Homicides by date:\n\n\u2022 Jan. 6 \u2013 Charles David Busby, 32, was fatally shot in the 7500 block Bellingrath Road.

A dispatch log indicates Ness later drove over a spike strip six miles east of Marias Pass, stopping his vehicle.\n\nWhat exactly transpired between Ness and law enforcement after he stopped isn\u0092t entirely clear, although a dispatch log indicates that at one point he got out of the vehicle and pointed a shotgun at Glacier County deputies before getting back into the parked vehicle.\n\nCurry said that while his deputies eventually responded to the scene, they initially stopped at the county line while awaiting a request for assistance from their Glacier County counterparts.\n\n\u0093We had our dispatch contact them, and finally Glacier County said, \u0091Yes, they\u0092d like us to continue,\u0092\u0094 Curry said. \u0093Our guys got on scene and said there were more patrol cars than they\u0092d seen in their lives.

Maybe you weren't, but people who were certain they knew how to properly handle their firearms were. And guess where they found out that they weren't really up to the task?

You can thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that none of the children at their swimming lessons at the Y were shot when mom blew a hole in her purse rummaging around down in Austin.\n\nA few \"coincidences\" worthy of note this time around: two people accidentally discharged their weapons while giving demonstrations of how safe they were, one lodging a bullet in his living room floor, and one lodging a bullet in a place that stopped him from living and left him on the floor. Last week also saw two young men accidentally shoot their mothers, one in Oconee Co., South Carolina, and one in Dayton, Nevada. And although this one doesn't exactly fit, an Orlando, Florida, man accidentally fired his gun twice while he was cleaning it (of course). His first shot flew through his garage door and into the street, where it blasted a hole in a passing car, and microseconds thereafter, the 12-year-old girl inside it. So flustered by this accident was he that he fired a second shot through his own thigh.\n\nThere were three \"home invasion\" shootings, in which civic-minded patriots opt to share their used ammunition with neighbors. The most worthy of note being the Marion, Ohio, accident in which a good guy with a shotgun decided to participate in the prayer meeting in the downstairs apartment. His testimony was witnessed by two of the ladies of the assembly.\n\nOutside of those noteworthy items, we saw the usual assortment of accidents. One hunting accident, one accident while \"fixing\" a gun, one target shooting mishap, one stray bullet shooting, and one cop's gun that went off when it was grabbed by a suspect.

They pushed him against a wall and one showed a firearm and demanded his wallet and phone. They then ran off.\n\nShortly after that, a man and woman walking into the courtyard of an apartment building, also in the 600 block of East White Street, were robbed at gunpoint of a backpack.

Rietz said a loaded gun and items taken in the robberies were found in the car. Cox and Murphy were arrested.

They are both due back in court on April 1.\n\nDuring the traffic stop, a sport utility vehicle that wasn\u2019t involved in the stop hit the side mirror of a pickup truck, then drove past a Champaign police officer and hit him with the passenger side mirror, spinning him out of the way. The officer was treated for minor injuries and then immediately returned to duty.\n\nUrbana police arrested the driver of the sport utility vehicle, Jeffrey J.

Evidence showed that during the altercation, Dowdy pulled a handgun and shot the other individual in the face. Dowdy then fled the scene. The incident was captured on videotape. The Columbia Police Department issued state warrants of attempted murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime (those state charges remain pending and Mr. Dowdy is innocent until proven guilty).\n\nDowdy was apprehended in Orangeburg on January 14, 2014. At the time of his state arrest on January 14, 2014, Dowdy had a loaded .357 caliber handgun in his possession. The investigation revealed that the handgun was the same handgun used in the January 3, 2014, incident. Dowdy is prohibited under federal law from possessing firearms and/or ammunition based upon his prior state convictions for burglary 2nd degree (2 separate offenses) and attempted burglary 2nd degree.\n\nThe case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Columbia Police Department, the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, and the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety and was prosecuted as part of the joint federal, state and local Project CeaseFire initiative, which aggressively prosecutes firearm cases.

Jackson, Detroit Free Press) Story Highlights Shots rang out at Al's Place Barber Shop around 6 p.m. Wednesday\n\nA man who will be questioned about the shooting was wearing body when he was arrested\n\nThe barbershop on Detroit's east side was known for gambling\n\nDETROIT -- A person of interest is in custody in connection with a shooting at an east side barbershop that left three dead and seven others injured, police announced Thursday.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig said Thursday that the man, a convicted felon, was wearing body armor when he was arrested on unrelated felony charges in suburban Rochester after the shootings Wednesday. His name wasn't immediately released.\n\nSTORY: 10 people shot at Detroit barbershop, at least 2 dead\n\nCraig said police are working with the U.S. Attorney's office to determine whether the man could be in violation of federal laws for being in possession of body armor.\n\nThe chief says someone shot a high-powered rifle through an open door into a backroom at the barbershop, where Craig says at least 20 people were \"engaged in gambling activities.\"\n\nHe said the shooting, which he called \"urban terrorism,\" might have been the result of an ongoing feud between the shooter and people at the gambling party, Craig said.\n\nCraig said that police received a 911 call at 5:47 p.m. Wednesday indicating shots had been fired. He said police were on scene by 5:49 p.m.\n\nTwo men who were struck inside the shop died on the scene, police said. The third victim, a 37-year-old man, died early Thursday at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Sgt. Mike Woody said.\n\nAs bullets came in, many of the people who were gathered inside ran for their lives, taking cover at nearby businesses, including a party store across the street.\n\nThe initial investigation, Craig said, revealed that 20 to 30 people were packed into a small room at the rear of the barbershop and were gambling.\n\nHe said a man pulled up in a vehicle and started firing at a truck with a high-powered rifle. At some point, the rear door of the shop opened and the shooter began firing inside of the business. Craig said nine people were shot inside of the location.\n\nHe said at least one person inside of the barbershop returned fire.\n\nInvestigators were searching for men driving two Chevrolet Impalas \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 involved in the shoot-out along Seven Mile Road between Mound and Ryan at about 6 p.m. Investigators said a shoot-out between the cars' occupants in an alley behind the building spilled over into the barbershop.\n\nPolice said the barbershop is known for gambling, and a dice game was taking place when the gunfire broke out. But a motive behind the shooting wasn't clear.\n\nLorne Carter, 48, was smoking a cigarette against the wall of a nearby business when he said he heard about 30 to 40 shots fired around 6 p.m. near the barbershop in the 5200 block of East Seven Mile.\n\n\"It sounded rapid,\" he said.\n\nCraig said all of the victims are male, but no ages or names were released.\n\nA distraught mother, who did not want to give her name, said she believes one of the men who was killed is her 40-year-old son. She said her three sons were in the barbershop at the time of the shooting, and one escaped and ran home to tell her and she rushed to the scene.\n\n\"I heard he's dead. \u2026 They won't let me up there,\" she said from a gas station near the scene.\n\nThat son had gone to the business to get bus money from his brother, she said. Her other two sons made it out uninjured.\n\nAt the barber shop today, the only clear visible evidence that a shooting had happened were the news vans parked nearby and strands of yellow police tale flapping in the breeze at several spots.\n\nA painted sign on the gray brick building says the shop was established in 1971. A handful of playing cards could be seen among some leaves outside the front door, and broken window glass from a vehicle lay in the alley behind the one-story shop. No one answered the door at Al's, but next door at another business, a man spoke through a glass storm door, telling a reporter that \"it's over.\"\n\nHe warned against taking pictures of the shop and closed the door.\n\nSeveral neighbors who were out walking had heard about the shooting but few said they were in the area at the time.\n\nBut Saifur Rahman, 19, was working at a fish and chicken shop across Seven Mile at the time of the shooting.\n\nHe heard a series of shots that sounded like they came from an automatic weapon.\n\nThree people \u2014all male, one older and two younger \u2014 ran into his shop and locked the outer door. Rahman was behind an interior door and they began pounding on that, telling him to let them in.\n\nHe thought he was being robbed.\n\n\"It was scary, you know, \" he said.\n\nThe three also started throwing food from various shelves onto the floor and appeared to be trying to hide. They snuck out when Rahman announced he was calling 911. He said police talked to him and took his store's surveillance tape.\n\nResidents described the neighborhood as a good one, with people attending church and participating in a block club, but all were aware of past violence at Al's.\n\n\"It's a good neighborhood, just some stuff went down,\" said one woman out walking her pit bull.

With concurrent and consecutive sentences, Calles is facing 26 years in prison.\n\n\u201cAnd no parole,\u201d said Trevor Lynch, the assistant district attorney and lead prosecutor in the case.\n\nThe crime took place in February 2014 at the Smith\u2019s La Vergne home. Isolated on its two acres, their home was a showplace with professional landscaper Sara Smith\u2019s constant work.\n\nAccording to testimony at the sentencing hearing, they answered the door to a young woman, asking questions. About a half an hour later, Rick Smith answered the door again, only to find himself pulled out of the house and beaten and kicked by two assailants. Around the corner of the house was German Calles.\n\nSara Smith came out to defend her husband, and Calles struck her in the head with a \u201cheavy metal object,\u201d believed to be a gun, Lynch said. He told the court that when Rick Smith refused to let them into the house, he was shot in the back by one of the men.\n\nAt that time, Calles fled the scene, but he would later stop at a restaurant.\n\nPublic defender Russell Perkins stated that Calles had been coerced into the crime by men he didn\u2019t even know and was not a willing participant, and that he went on to cooperate with law enforcement later.\n\nLynch said when Calles got to the restaurant, he did not ask to call the police or mention that he\u2019d been kidnapped.\n\nInstead, Lynch said, he asked for a menu, Lynch said. Calles not only ate a meal there, he went home and for six days went to work and then home again, until police caught up with him.\n\nThe woman and the other men involved have never been caught.\n\nCalles\u2019 actions, or lack thereof, after the attack were factors in Bragg\u2019s sentencing decision.\n\n\u201cThe callousness of these individuals, including the defendant in this case, made an impression on this court,\u201d Bragg said in his ruling.\n\nAbout Calles assertion that he was coerced into the crime, Bragg said: \u201cThe court does not find those statements to be credible. Neither did the jury.\u201d\n\nRick and Sara Smith testified at the beginning of the sentencing hearing, and both spoke of their losses.\n\nBesides the medial bills incurred by their injuries \u2014 Rick Smith still carries the bullet in his body and told the court he probably will for the rest of his life, the couple also lost their home \u2014 where he had lived for 28 years and she had joined him for the last 16 \u2014 when they found themselves unable to live there anymore, surrounded by fear and memories.\n\nThey have had to seek counseling and find a new home, but the hardest part, both said, was losing trust in other people.\n\n\u201cI always trusted people,\u201d said Rick Smith. \u201cUntil they shows us differently.\u201d\n\nSara Smith told the court how they used to live with open doors and drapes.\n\n\u201cIt changed our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, our doors were always open; drapes were never closed.

Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)\n\nThe young woman arrived home to find a footprint still visible on her front door. Her South Shore apartment had been broken into, and the small safe she kept under her bed was missing, along with the black .40-caliber Glock handgun she kept inside. Over the next year, that Glock would fire 42 bullets, leaving shell casings scattered on walkways, porches and side streets. In the hands of a street gang, the gun was used in at least five separate shootings that left two dead and five others wounded, police say. Officers found the weapon \u2014 loaded with 21 rounds and hidden in a Nike shoebox \u2014 during a routine check in 2015 at a parolee's South Side home, just blocks from where it had been stolen. An extended magazine had been added for firepower and a laser sight for accuracy. Armando L.

A Glock used in five shootings that killed two people sits at the Homan Square police facility June 9, 2016, in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) The story of the Glock's journey from safe to shoebox comes at a tumultuous time for Chicago as homicides spike to levels unseen in the city for two decades. Chicago police say the proliferation of guns plays a key role in the seemingly endless cycle of violence, particularly in impoverished pockets of the South and West sides. As police battle the glut of firearms, the Glock illustrates the devastation \u2014 both human and financial \u2014 that a single gun can leave behind. The Tribune spent several months retracing the gun's movements, visiting each shooting scene, talking to residents who two years later still remember the gunfire that interrupted their lives, speaking to the only victim willing to talk. The Glock was what police call a gang gun, passed among its members as needed. Its devastation \u2014 unusual for one firearm in a year's time \u2014 was spread over a significant stretch of the South Side. \"I've seen five young men lose their lives on this block,\" longtime resident Randolph Strahan said from his front yard in the 2700 block of East 76th Street, just steps from a neighbor's porch where a father of two was killed in the first shooting linked to the Glock by ballistics evidence. \"What's it like to live here?\" the retiree asked rhetorically when a reporter inquired about the block. His soft voice was nearly drowned out by the whistle of a Metra train passing nearby. \"Where are you from?\" he asked. \"You don't know what it's like to be numb.\" Armando L.

He said shootings on the block have left him numb. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) A gang's lifeblood With three months still to go in 2016, Chicago has already topped 530 homicides and 3,250 shootings, far more than in all of 2015. On so many levels, the cost of the runaway violence can be immeasurable. It has struck a blow to the city's psyche and national image and taken an emotional toll on survivors, the families of those killed and the larger community. Even the financial costs can be hard to fully tabulate. Taxpayers are sure to foot the bill for much of the hospital care for the thousands shot as well as the cost of law enforcement, including nearly 1,000 police officers being added to the department over the next two years. Just the public cost to investigate this one Glock's five shootings has been considerable. About 50 Chicago police officers responded to the shooting scenes, including technicians who checked for evidence and beat officers who guarded perimeters and talked to victims. Over the last decade, guns have accounted for a growing percentage of the city's homicides, a recent study by Lurie Children's Hospital found. In 2015, nearly nine out of every 10 homicides in Chicago involved guns, up 13 percentage points from just 10 years earlier, according to the study. Two factors make Chicago's gun violence distinct from other big cities \u2014 the strength and size of its street gangs as well as the easy access to firearms in neighboring states because of weak gun laws, said Philip Cook, professor of public policy at Duke University. \"Chicago ends up being surrounded by lax jurisdictions, and that makes it difficult to really control gun availability within the city,\" said Cook, who has studied Chicago's gun violence for years and written on the issue. \"That combined with the high violence rate (driven by gangs) \u2026 is the combination that is the killer, quite literally.\" Guns get to Chicago in many ways. In so-called straw purchases, those with a firearm owner's identification card can carve out a niche business buying guns in Illinois for felons barred from owning weapons because of their criminal records. Another option lies a few miles away over the border in Indiana, where gun shows require no background checks. A study in 2015 by the University of Chicago Crime Lab found 60 percent of the newer guns recovered from gang members had come from out of state \u2014 half of those from Indiana. In separate interviews done at Cook County Jail, gun offenders said gangs sometimes tapped members to make buying trips. \"All they need is one person who got a gun card in the 'hood and everybody got (a gun),\" the study quoted one inmate as saying. The Glock, though, was stolen on Jan. 17, 2014, from an apartment in the 1900 block of East 79th Street just four months after the owner purchased it legally at a Hoffman Estates Cabela's, the outdoor recreation chain. Nearly a year later, authorities recovered the gun only two blocks from where it had been stolen. The Glock was test-fired in the Police Department's forensics firearms unit and linked to 42 of the shell casings recovered at the five shootings, according to Anthony Riccio, chief of the Organized Crime Bureau. Gunmen had fired more than one weapon in two of the shootings. Police officials and gang experts said the gun would have been a hot commodity on the street because it was new and of much higher quality than so many of the 7,000 illegal guns seized in Chicago in 2014. According to numerous police records and interviews with researchers and Chicago police gang intelligence experts, the Glock appears to have been passed among members of the same gang. John J.

Drequan Archie was fatally shot, and another male was wounded. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Guns are the lifeblood of gangs, prized possessions often kept hidden away until needed, then handed out to any number of members who might be tapped to carry out a shooting, according to Riccio. Sometimes guns \"are kept under porches, kept in houses, hidden in traps in cars,\" he said. \"\u2026 They decide amongst themselves whose turn it is to pull the trigger, quite frankly.\" The shootings connected to the Glock hint at the epidemic of violence among gangs and the dilemma facing police. Three of the five victims who survived are themselves now locked up in Cook County Jail on unrelated charges. Many of the shooting victims were affiliated with the same gang and provided scant, if any, detail about who shot them, according to police and court records. None of the shootings has been solved.\n\n'Why I carry this banger' The trail of violence started on a porch in the 2700 block of East 76th Street on April 11, 2014, three months after and about a mile from where the Glock had been stolen. If you stretch your head up and gaze east from the porch's steps, you can see a bright blue stretch of Lake Michigan, just a few blocks away at Rainbow Beach. On the North Side, this would be prime real estate, but on this block, longtime residents say violence ebbs and flows. Strahan, 68, a retired electrician, said the violence was incessant a few years back when a gang controlled a corner store on the east end of the block. Two of those killings took place right across from his home, while three others died down the block, he said. \"This has been going on and escalating ever since my son was born 36 years ago. He is out of state. He got away. I am so glad he did,\" he said. On a recent warm evening, with the only noise coming from cicadas, he walked through his yard, pointing to bullet holes on the house next door and on his own brick home amid its blooming flowers in the front and a garden of tomatoes, beans, corn and cucumbers along the side. Strahan attributed most of the violence to gangs fighting over drug dealing. What led to the fatal shooting of Shannon Mack, a father of two, just a couple of doors down from Strahan's home remains uncertain, but during his autopsy, medical examiners found five plastic baggies containing a white powdery substance in Mack's mouth. Strahan said he had noticed earlier that night that a large group had gathered at the neighbor's house, hanging out on the porch. But Mack was alone on the front steps at 9:30 p.m. when someone approached and opened fire. To understand Chicago's violence, start at Kostner Avenue and Monroe Street and walk west up a one-way stretch of graystones and brick two-flats. There on a boarded-up front door you'll see the red stain of gang graffiti. On the cracked sidewalk below lies an empty heroin baggie. Hardened young... The crew of Fire Department Engine 126 found Mack unconscious, leaning against a porch railing. He was shot four times and pronounced dead at the scene. Four spent shell casings were recovered. At 34, Mack was the oldest of the Glock's seven victims. Court records show he had one felony drug conviction in 2003 and was sentenced to two years in prison for possessing a .380-caliber handgun in 2011. At the time of that arrest, he told officers he was carrying the gun for protection after someone he knew had been shot. \"These n------ out here are crazy. That's why I carry this banger,\" he said, according to the police report. Mack's former wife, Tanya Grant, with whom he had two sons, said he held much promise. He was smart and enjoyed writing rhyme and rap. But she wondered if like so many raised in Chicago's most troubled neighborhoods, he didn't have the resources to overcome the negative influences, opting instead to be the \"tough dude\" necessary to survive the mean streets. \"We don't have the answer,\" Grant said of what led to Mack's killing. \"It's a lot of pain in our communities. It's something that most people from the outside, they can't relate to. \u2026 Even though you try to cope and you try to heal the wound, you can't.\" 'Whatever God brings' Violence has become routine around 66th and State streets, but Ammar Awadh, the co-owner of a Citgo gas station at the corner just off the Dan Ryan Expressway, doesn't remember the shooting involving the Glock, the second one linked to the gun. According to police reports, a dark car pulled up beside another vehicle at the intersection about 12:45 a.m. Aug. 25, 2014. Someone in the dark car opened fire at the other vehicle. Two men in their early 20s were shot, one in the groin, the other in the thigh. The dark car fled north on State, and the victims drove themselves to the hospital. Both survived, police said. A dozen .40-caliber shell casings were recovered near the gas station. Another shooting in July of this year \u2014 not linked to the Glock \u2014 left a clerk at the station dead. When somebody put a gun on you, what you say? Nothing. Whatever God brings, welcome it. \u2014 Ammar Awadh Operating a business in this environment comes at a cost. Awadh said he has spent $10,000 on bulletproof glass protecting the cashier, $7,000 on surveillance cameras and $2,600 for added lighting. The business owner also has honed his street smarts \u2014 constantly reading customers to figure out if any pose a threat. \"Use your mind,\" he said of his strategy as he sat recently on a milk crate, the constant din of customers muffled behind the protective glass. \"Don't use your power.\" The shooting of his friend and co-worker has taken an emotional toll on Awadh, leading him to rely more heavily on his Muslim faith, he said. \"When somebody put a gun on you, what you say? Nothing,\" he said. \"Whatever God brings, welcome it.\" 'Help me, help me' The Glock's fourth victim, John Williams, insisted he had no idea why anyone would want to kill him. In a recent interview at Cook County Jail, where he is awaiting trial on an armed robbery charge, he acknowledged his lifestyle courted trouble, hanging out on the street too much. He had been shot once before, in December 2013, Williams said, but he denied being a gang member. Williams was on his way home from a friend's house on Oct. 25, 2014, when a car raced up behind his 2005 silver Grand Prix, and several people inside fired a fusillade of shots in the 2700 block of East 81st Street. As glass shattered, the 22-year-old grabbed his neck because of the stinging pain. He drove about a block before fleeing the car for help. \"It really don't matter who did it. I just want to know why. Why would anybody shoot me?\" Williams asked. \"I don't recall (doing anything) that would make anybody want to kill me.\" Police collected 38 shell casings at the scene. Thirteen had been fired from the Glock, while the rest came from two other guns used in the shooting. A woman who lived nearby came to Williams' aid, handing him a towel to try to stop the bleeding. \"He kept saying, 'Help me, help me,'\" said the neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of fear for her safety. \"He was crying. He said, 'I've been shot, I've been shot.'\" At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, doctors removed a bullet from his left arm that was wedged between two bones, leaving a thin seam of a scar running the length of his forearm. A bullet in the back of his neck could not be removed without risking further injury so doctors left it until muscle and tissue nudged it close enough to the surface of his skin. Doctors removed the bullet a month later, he said.

I mean, how do you wrap your mind around killing your wife, your two children, and your mother-in-law? You just can't,\" Cannon said.\n\n\"Suddenly, it just seems inappropriate to talk about him as a good deputy. It would be inappropriate to talk about the good things that he does when there is a family out there now suffering at the tragic and senseless loss of a mother and daughter and cousins and grandchildren. That's where the focus needs to be because that's where the real tragedy lies. There are four innocent victims who have died for no reason at all.\"\n\nNeighbors of the family shared in the disbelief expressed by law enforcement.\n\n\"The kids came over and played with our kids all the time, and I would always see them at the gym and would always wave to Kelly and Josh,\" said neighbor Brian Sloan. \"You feel sad for the kids and it is kind of weird, you see see this on TV and now it happens to a neighbor.\"\n\n\"We decided saying a prayer for the rest of the family was best,\" added neighbor Nadine Meyer. \"This is a very close-knit neighborhood, and we take care of each other. But when they are all gone, there is no one to take care of, which is difficult to deal with.\"\n\nBoth Cullimore and Cannon said they were aware of marital problems between Josh and Kelly Boren.\n\n\"I was aware there had been a brief set period of separation. I was not aware of any violence in the past or anything like that. Again, his wife, Kelly, was a friend of mine, a friend of my wife. So anything major that would have happened, I would have known about,\" Cullimore said.\n\nKelly Boren had worked in the Human Resources Department for the city of Bluffdale since August. Prior to that, she was the finance director for the town of Vineyard for six years.\n\nSpanish Fork police, who are investigating the killings, said Friday they believe that martial contention led to Boren shooting his family.\n\nThe first sign of trouble came Thursday night when Boren was scheduled to be at work at 10 p.m. When he hadn't arrived by 11 p.m., officers were sent to his house to do a welfare check.\n\n\"They were just concerned he hadn't arrived for work,\" Spanish Fork Police Chief Steven Adams said. \"If an officer is supposed to be on duty at 10 o'clock, he should be there at 10 o'clock. It might not be that in other businesses or employment. But if an officer doesn't arrive on duty at the time he's assigned, there's something amiss.\"\n\nWhen officers arrived at the home, they looked through the windows. The lights were on and the front door was unlocked.\n\nThrough the window, the officers could see blood on the carpet, shell casings, a handgun and even a slug, Adams said. After officers entered the home, they discovered \"a large quantity of blood on the stairway leading to the second floor of the residence.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law was found deceased in one upstairs bedroom, and the four others in another.\n\nThe last known phone contact with the Boren family was about 4:30 p.m. Thursday. That phone call was not of a distressed nature, Adams said. Police have never been called to the Boren house for a domestic call or complaint of any kind, he said. The family apparently had lived there for four or five years.\n\nPolice said neighbors did not report hearing any gunshots.\n\n\"This is a tragedy in anybody's life, whether you're in law enforcement as Joshua is, or not. Many of my officers that went on the scene are having a hard time with it. The things that go through their minds, asking the question that can't be answered, which is 'Why?'\" Adams said.\n\nAdams declined to say what evidence led detectives to believe Josh Boren killed his family before shooting himself. \"There are specific things we believe have happened in the home, those specific things I'm not going to get into today\" he said.\n\nPolice noted, however, that no suicide note was found.\n\nAdams said investigators would likely be going through the house for a couple of days collecting evidence. However, the biggest question may never be answered.\n\n\"We hope to gain an understanding at some time of all the things that were going through Josh's mind, but I'm certain we'll not be able to do that,\" the chief said.\n\nThe children, Josh and Haley, attended the American Leadership Academy charter school in Spanish Fork. The Nebo School District sent crisis counselors over to the school to assist students at the school Friday. The district also sent counselors to Spanish Fork Elementary School, even though the children never attended that school, to help other young students who may have heard the news.\n\nOn Kelly Boren's Facebook page, she posted an old picture of her children on Thursday. There are several pictures of her and her children enjoying a trip to Southern California and Disneyland at the end of December.\n\nDespite their known marital problems, Cannon said there was never a hint of potential violence on the part of Josh Boren.\n\n\"There was no indication to anybody this was going to happen. A number of people knew he was having struggles in his marriage, but that's not uncommon. People in all professions, in all areas of life, some have struggles with their marriages,\" he said. \"There was nothing going on that rose to the level of concern that anything bad in any way might happen.\"\n\nJosh Boren was hired by the Utah County Jail as a corrections officer in 2006. He worked several jobs, including as an animal control officer at one point. He left the jail to become a patrol officer for the 15-member Lindon Police Department in October. But he also continued to work at the jail part time. He was selected from a field of 70 qualified applicants to fill the Lindon position.\n\nUtah County offers an employee assistance program for anyone who is having problems at home or feeling stress, Cannon said. Employees can talk to counselors and their conversations will be kept confidential from their employer, unless the employee confesses illegal activity, he said.\n\nThe tragedy in Spanish Fork is the second incident in less than a week of a parent killing other members of their family before taking their own life.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kyler Ramsdell-Oliva, 32, shot her two daughters, Kenadee Oliva, 13, and Isabella Oliva, 7, in their Syracuse home before killing herself.\n\nThe mother had just broken up with her fiance and told him to leave their home. Close friend Pegi Butler said Ramsdell-Oliva had fought depression, but things in her life had improved in recent years. She confessed to Butler that she still loved the man deeply but was heartbroken. Still, Butler never suspected she or the girls were in any danger when they spoke on Sunday.\n\nIn 2013, the Deseret News counted seven incidents of domestic-related murder-suicides where anger, jealousy or depression appeared to be motivating factors. In 2012 there were four, according to statistics kept by the Deseret News.\n\n\"What's really important, I think, for folks to understand is that these really tragic incidents rarely happen in isolation. Often times there may be some other things that are happening. People may be feeling extremely desperate, depressed, they may have made threats to hurt themselves or other people in their family,\" said Kendra Wyckoff, interim director of the Utah Domestic Violence Council.\n\nWyckoff said it was important for those threats to be taken seriously.\n\nAs to why some people kill their children in addition to their significant other before killing themselves, she said she didn't have a good answer.\n\n\"Clearly, people are in a desperate place. We need to help people understand there are resources available. There is help.\"\n\nThere are two suicide hotlines in the state for people to get help.\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Hotline, 1-800-273-8255, operates 24 hours a day. The Utah Domestic Violence LINKLine is 1-800-897-LINK (5465).\n\nContributing: Shara Park, Sam Penrod\n\nTwitter: DNewsCrimeTeam", "publish_date": "2014-01-17"}, {"text": "Ruben \u0093Menace\u0094 Reyes pleaded guilty to all federal charges pending against him including the murder Balcones Heights Police Officer Julian Pesina and four Texas Mexican Mafia members.\n\n\n\n\n\n(...)\n\n\n\nReyes also admitted killing TMM \u0093Captain\u0094 Mark Anthony Bernal (aka \u0093Lefty\u0094), TMM \u0093General\u0094 Carlos Chapa (aka \u0093Worm\u0094), and TMM \u0093Lieutenant of Lieutenants\u0094 Johnny Solis (aka \u0093Smiley\u0094) for their alleged mishandling of approximately $60,000 and making poor decisions in regards to the TMM daily operations.

I saw a ... lady with a dog going into his apartment yesterday but that was it.\u201d\n\nThe staff at the complex left their office around 8 p.m. Friday and were unaware a woman was killed, they said. The complex has 30 units which house about 40 people.\n\nPolice are routinely called for disturbances there and the multiple cop cars that showed up when the victim was found didn\u2019t worry many people, several residents said.\n\n\u201cIt was bound to happen with everybody around here,\u201d said a neighbor, who didn\u2019t want to be identified. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of apartments it is.\u201d\n\nThe complex does have issues with people drinking and sometimes has disturbances, but nothing ever as violent as a homicide, Galindo said.\n\nThe woman\u2019s death marks the first homicide in Pasco in more than a year, Raymond said.\n\nw Tyler Richardson: 582-1556; trichardson@tricityherald.com; Twitter: @Ty_richardson", "publish_date": "2014-01-04"}, {"text": "TSA Week in Review: April 1 - 7 April 11, 2019 | 6 (# of comments) Winter is coming!

The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.\n\n\u201cAfter the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,\u201d said Lt.

The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.\n\nThe memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it\u2019s the parking lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals.

Eric Melendez said.\n\nThe woman had made several 911 calls to the Pleasanton police dispatch center, prompting the request, Melendez said.\n\nTwo officers made contact with the woman Tuesday night and were talking to her when police say she displayed a handgun in a threatening manner. Police then retreated to the parking lot of the complex while giving commands for the woman to drop the gun, Melendez said.\n\nWhen the woman refused to drop the weapon, one officer fired four to five shots, Melendez said. That prompted the woman to stagger, fall and roll down the stairs from her second-story apartment. The officer who fired was not identified but is a young officer who has been on the force for one year, police said.\n\nOfficials did not say how many shots hit the woman or where she was struck.\n\nEmergency personnel were called, and the woman was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where she died from her injuries. Both police officers have been put on administrative leave.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time police had come to the apartment.\n\nOn Jan. 24, undercover officers from the Pleasanton Police Department served a search warrant at the Hayward apartment and found guns, drugs and other contraband, said Pleasanton police Sgt.

He has been charged with dealing heroin and possession of automatic weapons.\n\nMelendez said Wednesday that the woman had previously called Pleasanton police, saying she was upset about how she had been treated in a recent contact. Asked to elaborate, Sgt. Melendez said he couldn\u2019t do so.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms Explosives Control has taken over that case.\n\nThe woman\u2019s name has not been released pending notification of next of kin.

Vaughn, 25, guilty of first-degree murder and unlawful possession of weapons by a felon.\n\nVaughn was charged with shooting Demetrius C. Lucas, 30, at the Storey Manor Apartment complex in Cottage Hills. Officers from the Alton Police Department responded to the apartment complex following a report of shots fired at approximately 10 p.m. Feb. 5, 2014. They determined that there had been a shooting and that Lucas had been taken to Alton Memorial Hospital before their arrival.\n\nLucas had been shot twice and was transferred to a St. Louis-area hospital shortly thereafter and pronounced dead about an hour later. Vaughn, who lived in the apartment complex, was taken into custody around 2:30 a.m. on Feb. 6, 2014. The investigation determined the men got into an argument during a dice game at a birthday party for Vaughn that escalated into the shooting death of Lucas.\n\nAssistant State\u2019s Attorneys Crystal Uhe and Rachelle Crowe began presenting evidence to the jury Tuesday. They argued that Vaughn deliberately shot Lucas rather than as an act of self-defense, as claimed by Vaughn\u2019s defense attorneys.\n\nOn Thursday, Circuit Judge Richard Tognarelli denied a motion by the defense that would have allowed jurors to consider self-defense in their deliberations.\n\nVaughn had previous felony convictions from 2011 for mob action and unlawful restraint.\n\n\u201cThis was a dispute that turned violent in the worst way,\u201d Madison County State\u2019s Attorney Thomas Gibbons said. \u201cI hope that this guilty verdict helps restore justice for our entire community and also serves as a message that we will not allow acts of violence such as this to prevail.\u201d\n\nVaughn will remain in custody at the Madison County Jail in Edwardsville pending sentencing, which is expected to happen in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe murder conviction carries a minimum of 20 years in prison.

Tom Hansen said that after the verbal exchange, the suspects drove by again and fired multiple rounds, striking the four boys.\n\nAll were taken to area hospitals to be treated for their wounds, which were serious but not life-threatening.\n\nHansen said that while the exchange about the clothing leads police to believe the shooting may have been gang-motivated, investigators have no reason to think any of the victims are involved with a gang.\n\n\u201cThere was some conversation between the victims and the suspects. Some of the words the suspects used leads us to believe that it could have gang motivated,\u201d Brentwood Police Department Captain Tom Hanson told KCBS.\n\n\u201cHowever, we have no reason to believe that the victims are engaged in gang activity, affiliated, or gang members at all,\u201d said Hanson.\n\nHe said that although Brentwood is \u201cnot immune\u201d to gang activity, it is rare in the town of about 52,000.\n\n\u201cThis is something that doesn\u2019t happen often in Brentwood, so obviously we\u2019re shocked and we\u2019re going to work diligently to identify who did this,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nAn investigation into the shooting is under way and police are attempting to identify witnesses that might lead them to the suspects.\n\nA description of the suspects was not immediately available.

They were each charged with one count of robbery conspiracy, eight counts of robbery, two counts of brandishing a firearm during a violent crime, and Pickett alone was charged with being a felon-in-possession of a firearm.\n\nCraig was also charged with JARRYL WILLIAMS, 42, in a separate four-count federal indictment involving the Jan. 10 armed robbery, involving four suspects, of James and Williams Jewelers, located at 7020 West Cermak Rd., in Berwyn.

Williams, who was shot by a store security officer, was also charged with being a felon-in-possession of a firearm with a partially obliterated serial number.\n\nCraig and Williams have each pleaded not guilty to the charges involving the Berwyn attempted robbery. Craig and Pickett are scheduled to be arraigned on May 1 in U.S. District Court. Craig and Williams were initially arrested previously on related state charges but were later transferred to federal custody, where they remain. Pickett has been in federal custody since he was arrested in March on a criminal complaint.\n\nAccording to the Craig and Pickett indictment returned yesterday, both defendants allegedly participated in the following robberies:\n\nDunkin Donuts, 3910 West Touhy Ave., Lincolnwood, on Oct. 20, 2013;\n\nPhillips 66 gas station, 1234 Sheridan Rd., North Chicago, on Oct. 21, 2013;\n\nShell gas station, 9600 Crawford Ave., Skokie, on Oct. 21, 2013;\n\nShell gas station, 3 East Algonquin Rd., Arlington Heights, on Oct. 31, 2013;\n\nMarathon gas station, 242 Waukegan Rd., Glenview, on Oct. 31, 2013;\n\nShell gas station, 5055 Touhy Ave., Skokie, on Nov. 30, 2013; and\n\nSeven-Eleven, 500 Skokie Blvd., Wilmette, on Nov. 30, 2013.\n\nCraig alone was also charged with the Dec. 13, 2013, robbery of Ted\u2019s Jewelers, 5334 South Archer Ave., Chicago, while Pickett alone was charged with the Feb. 19, 2014, robbery of EZ Pawn store, 4080 Southwest Hwy., Hometown, in which jewelry valued at approximately $73,000 was stolen.\n\nAccording to court documents, the charges stem from an FBI investigation of a series of similar armed robberies and attempted robberies last fall and winter of retail stores and businesses in Chicago, as well as northern and western suburbs. Typically, one or more participants entered each business and brandished a black semi-automatic handgun while demanding money or jewelry, and, in some instances Newport cigarettes. The participant or participants attempted to disguise their appearance but video surveillance provided a similar pattern of clothing and appearance.\n\nThe investigation is continuing.\n\nEach count of robbery and robbery conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and each count of brandishing a firearm carries a consecutive, mandatory minimum of seven years in prison and a maximum of life.

Driving around the area to see if he could find someone related to that, Quinley spotted a man on a bicycle whom he identified as Rommell Smith.\n\nSmith, 23, now homeless, had been wanted by police in connection with cannabis and a gun that police found in the Vawter Street apartment where Smith was living in February.\n\nMorgan said about 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 2, police were sent to an apartment complex in the 2000 block of Vawter Street where several shots had been fired. No one was present but within minutes, police located Smith at a nearby convenience store with cuts and abrasions, some of which happened when he fell running away.\n\nSmith reported he was in the Vawter apartment when several men forced their way in. Morgan said Smith fought, pulling a gun to defend himself. In the struggle over the gun with one of the intruders, several shots were fired.\n\nThe intruders fled, as did Smith, Morgan said.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after the shots-fired call, a man with multiple gunshot wounds was dropped off at the emergency room entrance at Carle Foundation Hospital, Morgan said.\n\n\"In spite of being shot five times, he got up and walked in,\" said Morgan, declining to identify that man, who survived the shots.\n\nMorgan said Smith was being treated there at the same time for cuts to his hands.\n\nMeantime, back at the Vawter apartment, police searched and found more than 500 grams of cannabis, packaging materials and .380-caliber ammunition. Smith was not arrested that day.\n\nMorgan said about two weeks later, on Feb. 14, police were sent to another shots-fired call at an apartment in the 1700 block of East Florida Avenue. Morgan said police learned that Smith had been staying at the apartment where a shot went through the floor into the apartment below. The caliber of the gun fired that afternoon matched the caliber of one of the two weapons that had been fired in the Vawter home invasion earlier that month.

She was the mother of two of Middleton\u2019s children and was an impeccable dresser, which helped detectives at the time see through evidence Middleton tried to plant to make it look like a car jacking.\n\nArchives say she was wearing a blue suit at the time and Middleton put green shoes in the trunk with her. Middleton was also convicted of tampering with evidence in the case. The couple\u2019s children were 4 and 1 years old at the time, archives say.\n\n\"I strangled her,\" Middleton said with his voice cracking during his sentencing hearing, according to a 2001 Plain Dealer story. \"I put her in the trunk,\" he said after a long pause, tears flowing. \"And I took her to Shaker Square.

Middleton grabbed her, started choking her and slammed her head through a wall.\n\nMiddleton was also arrested in 1997, according to archives, for choking Spencer.

The tampering with evidence sentence, which is for six years, will run concurrent with the murder sentence.\n\nPittman appeared detached as Morgan read through the plea deal. After the hearing, Pittman\u2019s attorney, Public Defender George Googe, described Pittman\u2019s mental state as \u201cnumb\u201d throughout the process.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pittman will have spent nearly two-thirds of his life behind bars by the time he is eligible for release. According to Googe, Pittman will be eligible for a 15-percent reduction in his sentence for good behavior and will receive credit for already serving 1.5 years since his arrest, but even then, Pittman would be 55 when he is released.\n\nPittman will not be allowed on work release and is not allowed to have contact with witnesses or Greenlee\u2019s family, according to the plea agreement.\n\nRoger Wright, a victim advocate for Greenlee\u2019s family, read a statement in court on behalf of the family.\n\n\u201cWe agree to the terms of the plea agreement in order to bring healing to our grief-stricken family and to others impacted by the crimes of Mr. Pittman,\u201d Wright said.\n\nCLOSE A victim advocate gives a statement on behalf of Olivia Greenlee's family, Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015.

Police said Pittman tried to make Greenlee\u2019s death appear as a suicide and portrayed himself as a worried fianc\u00e9 in the aftermath.\n\nBy pleading guilty, Pittman waived his right to have all of the evidence in the case presented. According to Judge Morgan, there was still outstanding forensic evidence that had not been processed.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jody Pickens said the remaining evidence would not have mattered.\n\n\u201cThe state will be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Olivia Greenlee was murdered by the defendant after she left Quiznos at approximately 7:20 p.m.,\u201d Pickens said in court.\n\nOther evidence pointing to Pittman included the state\u2019s determination that Greenlee was shot from a distance of 8 to 10 inches, which, according to Pickens, is atypical for a suicide. Also, Greenlee\u2019s blood was found on Pittman\u2019s left shoe, which would be consistent with Pittman sitting in the car at the time of the murder.\n\nPittman and Greenlee were 21 at the time. Pittman was originally charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. His case was expected to go to trial in November.\n\nGreenlee, who was from Dyersburg, was a senior majoring in music education. Pittman, who is from Milan, was a senior majoring in Christian ministries.\n\nAccording to Pickens, Greenlee had been working on save-the-date notices for their upcoming wedding.

View More\n\nPolice say they believe Zack never intended to hurt others that day, and his family hopes the tragedy will help raise awareness about teen suicide; now the school district is working to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again and that other students considering suicide get counseling.\n\nAfter the shooting, the school immediately went on lockdown as students with cellphones contacted their parents with frantic phone calls and texts to tell them what was happening.\n\nA public memorial service for Zack is planned for 6:30 p.m. Sunday in the Bend High Auditorium.\n\nZack\u2019s parents, Daniel and Leanna, have also created a scholarship through the Central Oregon Community College Foundation for Bend High students interested in technical and trade pathways.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our son Zack. He was a funny and loving young man, and we love and miss him very much,\u201d his parents wrote in an email. \u201cWe are humbled and blessed by the love and support we have received from the community. With God\u2019s help, we hope that this horrible situation will raise awareness and prevent more teen suicides in the future.\u201d\n\nBend Interim Police Chief Jim Porter said he is limited on the amount and nature of information he can release because the investigation is ongoing. He did confirm that Zack used his own hunting rifle to end his life.\n\n\u201cThe initial investigation indicates he was no threat to anyone else and had no intent on harming anyone other than himself,\u201d Porter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when he entered the campus with the gun and it\u2019s still too early to know the true motivation.\u201d\n\nPorter said school staff followed protocol to ensure the children were safe.\n\n\u201cSome of the parents outside were upset we wouldn\u2019t release their kids, but really the only absolutely safe place for those kids to be was inside that school where they are protected by police,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed to determine he was acting alone and there were no other accomplices or threats before we let anyone go.\u201d\n\nThe staff and students are constantly drilled on what to do when a lockdown is in effect, said Bend-La Pine Communication Director Julianne Repman. She said the fact that the suicide occurred in a modular building highlights a safety concern about the buildings, which are scheduled for removal.\n\n\u201cWe are always thinking of ways to improve safety,\u201d Repman said. \u201cThe last school bond we went out for was to fund taking out the modular buildings and put in a brick-and-mortar structure.\u201d\n\nZack\u2019s woodworking teacher, Don Carter, said Zack was a teaching assistant in his Woodworking I class. Carter said Zack was skilled at woodworking and often completed projects for other departments in the school, but what he really enjoyed was helping other students.\n\n\u201cI asked him how a project was going and he said it was going well but that he\u2019d put it on hold because he\u2019d really rather help people,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHe made that statement last week and it will stick with me because it really sums him up. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll take away from this and is something his folks should be proud of.\u201d\n\nCarter is a newcomer to Bend High and said Zack made him feel welcome.\n\n\u201cHe helped me understand the equipment and the protocol,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHe was super conscientious about helping people.\u201d\n\nBend-La Pine Schools Superintendent Ron Wilkinson wrote in an email to district staff last Sunday that \u201cthe team at BSHS did an amazing job responding to a horrific situation.\u201d\n\nTeen suicide is a nationwide problem, according to data from the National Institutes of Health. Suicide rates for children age 10 to 14 in 2007 were just under 1 per 100,000 kids, while rates for 15- to 19-year-olds were 6.9 per 100,000.\n\nIn Deschutes, Crook and Jefferson counties combined there have been six or fewer suicides for 10- to 19-year-olds per year since 2003, according to Jonathan Modie, communications officer for the Oregon Health Authority.\n\n\u201cWe take any threat by a student seriously and investigate,\u201d Repman said. \u201cWe want students to know that if they hear anything threatening, at all, we want them to let us know immediately.\u201d\n\nThe school was on lockdown for two hours following the shooting while police investigated the incident and crisis counselors attended to students. Wilkinson said administrators continue to work with law enforcement to evaluate current protocols and ensure safety at campuses across the district.\n\n\u201cBe sure you require all your classroom and building visitors and volunteers to check in and out at the main office and to wear their visitor badges,\u201d he wrote in Sunday\u2019s email. \u201cEmpower your fellow staff and students to question anyone in your schools who is not wearing a badge.\u201d\n\nRepman said there are several programs in the works to empower students and staff to watch for and report any signs of safety threats. She said the district has been developing those programs since last fall, but said it\u2019s even more important in the wake of last week\u2019s shooting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on adding another regional safety officer, which should happen in fall 2014,\u201d Repman said. \u201cWe\u2019re also talking with law enforcement about adding another school resource officer, but that\u2019s not a done deal.\u201d\n\nThe district is also working on a two-way texting communication system that allows students to report possible threats without having to speak directly to someone.\n\n\u201cReporting possible threats is a thing that kids might not want to do in a face-to-face situation, and this will allow it,\u201d Repman said. \u201cThe system will be set up to look for keywords, like bullying or suicide, and send auto-responses, such as instructing the student to call 911 immediately.\u201d\n\nShe also said the district plans to find a consultant to do a site visit to all district schools to assess safely levels and make recommendations on improvements.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0376, sking@bendbulletin.com\n\n5929734", "publish_date": "2014-02-15"}, {"text": "BRICK, N.J.

A search warrant was executed Wednesday in Walton County, Ga., by DeKalb County and Georgia officers.\n\nEvidence from that search warrant and several other items were presented to District Attorney Mike Odell, who issued warrants Thursday.\n\n\"Our officers have worked non-stop on this case for over two weeks,\" Harris said. \"I am so proud of the job they have done in making these arrests. The District Attorney has been with us every step and we are glad to get this case to this point.

Meanwhile, the girl headed to the laundry room to get dressed.\n\n\"She didn't feel she was properly dressed to see her brother so when she saw him in the hallway, that's why she shut the door which makes perfect sense but the movement of the door he interpreted incorrectly and he fired through the door.\"\n\nPolice say after the shooting the girl yelled out for her brother.That's when he realized what had happened. They say he called 911 and she was brought to Mercy Hospital with flesh wounds on her arm and torso.\n\n\"I'm told she was amazingly calm.\"\n\nDeputy Cheif Dan Davis says Johnson is still being held but hasn't been charged yet.\n\n\"He certainly realizes that he made some very poor decisions and assumptions.\"\n\nBut they say that doesn't excuse what he did.\n\n\"We believe that shooting a gun through a door at an on identifiable target is unreasonable.\"\n\nCalling 911 is what Davis recommends anyone does if they hear an intruder, and he says if that isn't an option...\n\n\"Another option is to call out and challenge to identify that as a homeowner or a resident that you are there and that you're armed. Let that be known before you just arbitrarily shoot through a door.\"\n\nThe victim's mother says she's doing well and that this was just a freak accident that happened to their family.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nUPDATED Thursday, January 9, 2014 --- 12:05 p.m.\n\nJanesville Police say a 20-year-old man shot and wounded his 13-year-old sister after he thought she was an intruder.\n\nThe shooting happened around 1:00 p.m. Wednesday at a home in the 3300 block of Spaulding Avenue.\n\nOfficers say 20-year-old Sidney Johnson was visiting his family's home, and didn't know his sister was there.\n\nHis 13-year-old sister was sleeping, and awoke when Johnson arrived. She made her way to the laundry room, trying not to be seen since she still had to get dressed.\n\nJohnson heard someone moving around, and assumed it was an intruder.\n\nPolice say Johnson took his father's gun, and shot through the laundry room door.\n\nThe 13-year-old girl suffered injuries to her right arm and the right side of her torso.

VPC\n\nMichael Guzzo shot and killed a family of four and two dogs in Phoenix on Saturday before killing himself.\n\nMichael Guzzo shot and killed four members of a family and two of their five dogs before taking his own life Saturday, Oct. 26, 2013, in Phoenix. (Photo: Screengrab from KPNX-TV, Phoenix, video) Story Highlights Youngest victim, Shannon Moore, 17, was autistic\n\nGunman's ex-wife said he grappled with extreme depression and increasing isolation\n\nEx-wife says depression grew worse with age; anyone who set him off was a potential victim\n\nPHOENIX -- Michael Guzzo's life ended as his former wife predicted \u2014 at his own hand \u2014 but Janet Guzzo said she never envisioned her ex-husband killing anyone else as he sought to end his own deep depression.\n\nGuzzo shot a family of four, including an autistic 17-year-old boy, before killing himself with a shotgun in his Phoenix apartment on Saturday morning, according to police.\n\nSTORY: Still no answers in Phoenix quadruple homicide\n\nOn any other Monday, 66-year-old Bruce Moore, would have escorted Shannon Moore, 17, to the bus, neighbors said, so Shannon could attend classes at a Phoenix high school dedicated to meeting the needs of special-education students in a small-school environment.\n\nInstead, grief counselors met with students at the school, and many of the conversations centered around one theme: Why Shannon?\n\n\"He was such a nice kid. How could this happen to him? Why him?\" said Craig Pletenik, a Phoenix Union High School District spokesman who related the questions that the counselors received. \"He was at home. Are any of us safe? If you are not safe in your home, where are you safe?\"\n\n\u201cHe always was just such a troubled individual. You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' \u201d Janet Guzzo, Michael Guzzo's ex-wife\n\nPolice said many of the answers to the questions Shannon's classmates were grappling with probably died with Guzzo on Saturday.\n\nGuzzo used a pump-action shotgun to murder Bruce and Shannon Moore, along with Shannon's parents, Michael and Renee, and two of the family's five dogs, in a townhome the family had owned for decades, according to police. Neighbors said Guzzo often argued with pet owners about barking dogs in the development, and police said Guzzo shot at another dog-owning neighbor on Saturday before returning to his own unit and killing himself.\n\nJanet Guzzo, who was married to Guzzo for more than a decade before they divorced in 1999, said the barking dogs and the presence of a weapon, coupled with Guzzo's extreme depression and increasing isolation, could have all contributed to Saturday's murders.\n\n\"He always was just such a troubled individual,\" said Janet, a psychiatric nurse. \"You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' \"\n\nThere were few new details Monday about the family Guzzo murdered, aside from school officials' comments and information available through court records.\n\nA relative of the Moores' declined to comment Monday when reached at her home.\n\nA neighbor who has lived in the complex for more than 40 years said Bruce Moore moved to the unit to care for a relative and that his daughter and her family had joined him within the last few years.\n\nShannon was a student at Phoenix's Central High School before he transferred to Desiderata in April, Pletenik said. Word about Shannon's death had spread quickly through the tiny school Monday, Pletenik said, where about 40 students had met with counselors.\n\n\"Something like this impacts them a lot because of the size of the school,\" Pletenik said.\n\nMichael worked at a pharmacy during the early 2000s when he also was attending college and pursuing a degree in criminal justice, according to court records.\n\nRenee and Michael were married in March 1996, divorced in 2004 and were re-married in January 2006, according to court documents.\n\nCourt filings list Michael's employer as the U.S. Army, but government officials were unable to confirm any details related to his service.\n\nNeighbors said that Renee and Michael had recently returned from China and that Renee was excited to get her five dogs out of quarantine. Charise Hatchett, who lived nearby, said Renee left a note on Friday asking Hatchett to drop off her dog for a grooming appointment.\n\nThe Arizona Humane Society took possession of the three dogs that survived the shooting.\n\n\"It's just so tragic,\" Hatchett said.\n\nJanet said her ex-husband had never complained to her about his neighbors, but said his deep-seated depression, which grew worse with age, made anyone who set him off a potential victim.\n\n\"It was a case of mental illness, and (he) chose not to address it,\" she said.\n\n\"Sadness, isolation. It's hard to get your hand around it because it's not tangible. He is a nice person, and he wasn't a bad person; he did a very bad thing,\" Janet said. \"They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bxcHGw", "publish_date": "2013-10-28"}, {"text": "PEORIA \u2014 A 63-year-old man discovered a stray bullet lodged in a wall decoration in his Central Peoria home Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe man discovered a bullet hole in his garage in the 1200 block of West McClure Avenue two weeks before.

The state will likely request the maximum 10-year sentence, but Furlong said he will recommend the judge to impose the minimum five-year prison sentence.\n\nBush was originally charged with murder, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a weapon on allegations he armed himself with a pistol and fired a kill shot that ripped through Lewis\u2019s skull on Middle Rose Street near Brunswick Avenue in Trenton\u2019s North Ward.\n\nTwanna Robinson heard two gunshots that night and then saw Bush standing above her fianc\u00e9 Lewis, who was lying motionless on the ground. \u201cYou going to jail!\u201d she immediately shouted at Bush, who fled from the scene in a vehicle, according to Robinson\u2019s witness testimony.\n\nAt Bush\u2019s initial murder trial in March, Mercer County Superior Court Judge Robert Billmeier declared a mistrial after the state\u2019s final witness gave potentially inflammatory testimony on the witness stand. The state was preparing to retry the case, but then Bush fell into more legal troubles that gave him an incentive to take a plea deal.\n\nBush, who has been incarcerated at the Mercer County Correction Center since surrendering Aug. 30, 2013, was re-arrested Sept. 18 and charged with third-degree witness tampering and fourth-degree contempt. He is accused of recently contacting a witness in his homicide case and asking her about the welfare of her children and contacting the boyfriend of another witness in violation of a judge\u2019s no-contact order.\n\nAuthorities say Bush was willing to offer something of value to a witness not to testify against him. The new criminal charges have resulted in Bush being jailed without bail on pretrial detention; he was previously being held on high monetary bail on the murder charges.\n\nConsidering that a trial by jury could have found Bush guilty of first-degree murder and considering that Bush has accrued four years of jail credit, he ultimately decided to resolve his homicide case by pleading guilty to second-degree provoked manslaughter in a deal that may also resolve the witness tampering case, according to Furlong.\n\nThe state has obtained a communications data warrant to explore whether Bush has made any further contact with witnesses, but Furlong said he is \u201cconfident\u201d the state will not find any such evidence.\n\n\u201cThe state has said based on the investigation to date, if nothing else comes out, they would be willing to let him plead guilty to contempt of court fourth-degree to run concurrent to manslaughter,\u201d Furlong said.\n\nIf Bush is allowed to resolve his pending witness tampering case by pleading guilty to fourth-degree contempt at his Dec. 1 sentencing hearing, he would be sentenced to serve concurrent terms not to exceed 10 years. He would have to serve 85 percent of the manslaughter term and would be awarded four years of jail credit. Under that scenario, if a judge sentenced Bush to seven years of incarceration, he would end up serving less than two years in state prison for killing local hip-hop sensation Young Farr in cold blood.", "publish_date": "2017-10-12"}, {"text": "FAIRFIELD-\n\nFairfield Police arrested four men Friday in the shooting death of 16-year-old Naomy Rojas.\n\nRojas was found dead Feb. 15 near an apartment complex on Phoenix Drive.\n\nNearly two weeks later, homicide detectives arrested four people: 24-year-old Jovon Granado, 21-year-old Robert Dishman, 19-year-old Eric Rico and 22-year-old Jesus Rodriguez.\n\nRead more: Teen\u2019s Family Hope Killer is Brought to Justice\n\nPolice say Granado and Rico were already in custody for other charges and rearrested Friday for the shooting.\n\nInvestigators believe the four men went to confront someone that was with Rojas when shots were fired.

That's when her estranged husband Christopher Justice surprised her with a gun outside. Shirley was shot more than a dozen times and clung to life.\n\nAfter the shooting, the estranged husband appeared before a judge in Kentucky, where he had fled and where lead homicide Detective Marcus Kennedy attended his hearing. During several years of rehab and multiple surgeries, Shirley and her family hoped that other women would use her tragic tale to escape domestic abuse.

Kennedy. \"She was a super strong lady, it broke my heart, too, to hear she passed away.\"\n\nKennedy is one of IMPD's veteran homicide detectives assigned to the case.

In 1991, a jury found him guilty of aggravated murder for killing a man during a drug deal.\n\nHill, 47, spent 18 years in prison for that slaying.\n\nThis time, he could be sentenced to life without parole.\n\nThe jury in the drive-by case deliberated for about an hour on Thursday afternoon and just over an hour on Friday morning before convicting Hill of aggravated murder, attempted murder, felonious assault and tampering with evidence.\n\nCommon Pleas Judge Julie M. Lynch will sentence him on Tuesday.\n\nPatricia Pallenberg, 54, died when shots were fired into a truck in which she was a passenger on Hiawatha Street north of E. Hudson Street on the night of Feb. 11, 2014. The driver of the truck was not injured.\n\nWitnesses at the trial included Hill\ufffds co-defendant, Terry R. Nichols. He testified that he was driving a pickup truck with Hill as a passenger and told Hill to shoot at another truck, mistakenly thinking that the occupants included a man with whom he had a dispute. One bullet struck Pallenberg in the head.\n\nColumbus police responded quickly to the shooting, with officers in a helicopter spotting Hill and Nichols stopping at a McGuffey Road duplex where Hill lived. A .38-caliber handgun that officers found hidden in the ceiling of the residence contained Hill\ufffds DNA, testimony showed. Tests also found gunshot residue on Hill\ufffds left hand and his clothing.\n\nPolice recovered two .38-caliber slugs from the shooting but were unable to match them to the gun.\n\nThe driver of the truck that came under fire, Robert Beck, identified Hill in court as the shooter.\n\nHill did not testify.\n\nAssistant Prosecutor Elizabeth Geraghty told jurors in her closing argument that all the evidence linking Hill to the shooting was too much to be a coincidence. She tried the case with Assistant Prosecutor Anthony Pierson.\n\nDefense attorney Mahlon Nowland implied that Nichols was the shooter and said he was not credible because of the deal he struck with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony. Police found gunshot residue on Nichols and a mixture of DNA on the gun, testimony showed.\n\nNichols, 48, pleaded guilty in April to involuntary manslaughter with a firearm specification and attempted murder in an agreement that required him to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nProsecuting and defense attorneys have recommended that Nichols be sent to prison for 18 years when he is sentenced by Lynch on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to a life sentence for aggravated murder, Hill could receive 11 years for attempted murder and three years for tampering with evidence. The felonious-assault and attempted-murder convictions are likely to be merged for sentencing purposes.\n\nJurors also found him guilty of four gun specifications and three drive-by shooting specifications, which could add more than 20 years to his sentence.\n\nSeparately, Lynch convicted Hill of possessing a gun despite a past felony conviction, which carries a maximum sentence of three years. She also could add decades to his sentence if she finds he is a repeat violent offender.\n\nHill was sentenced to 15 years to life, plus three years for using a gun, in 1991 in the shooting death of Vaughn Price, 24.\n\nHe was paroled in August 2009 and released from supervision in 2010.\n\njfutty@dispatch.com\n\n@johnfutty", "publish_date": "2015-08-28"}, {"text": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Prosecutors say more investigation is needed to determine whether he saw her before he allegedly drove over her.\n\n\"The evidence shows that Lamarcus Calvin was the driver of the car seen on the video at the Elks Club (Charity Lodge #1397) that resulted in the death of Jalisa Love,\" Muskegon County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Timothy M. Maat said Oct. 18. \"We'll prove that the defendant had reason to know he hit someone with his car and failed to report it when he reached a place of safety.\n\n\"Other possible charges will be evaluated once the investigation is completed,\" Maat said. \"The investigation remains active, and our office urges anyone who has information to contact the Muskegon Police Deparment or Muskegon County Silent Observer.\"\n\nLamarcus Calvin\n\nCalvin's court-appointed attorney could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\n\nLove, 20, died after being transported to a local hospital. Authorities have said she was first shot, then run over by a fleeing vehicle early Sept. 22.\n\nIt happened after a shootout outside the lodge at 149 Ottawa St. that left two men dead and at least four people wounded in addition to Love. Killed by gunfire were Dupree Johnson, 20, and Ja'Colby Brown, 20.\n\nPolice had been seeking the fleeing vehicle since shortly after the incident. An arrest warrant was issued for Calvin Tuesday, Oct. 15, and he was taken into custody Wednesday, Oct. 16.\n\nAt Calvin's arraignment, Muskegon County 60th District Judge Michael J. Nolan set a family surety bond of $10,000, which was posted by Calvin's mother, on condition Calvin observe a dusk-to-dawn curfew unless with her. A family surety bond doesn't require money to be posted, only that a family member sign a form committing to pay if the defendant doesn't show up for future court dates.\n\nThat bond was a reduction from an interim cash or surety bond of $50,000 that had been set by a magistrate who signed Calvin's arrest warrant. A cash or surety bond requires a defendant to post the full amount before being released, using either his own cash or money borrowed from a bail bondsman.\n\nCalvin is the second person to be charged with a felony in connection with the events outside the Charity Lodge. Antonio Keshawn Raglin, 20, of Muskegon Heights, faces trial on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, lying to police and possessing a firearm while committing a felony, charged as a third-time habitual offender.\n\nAs of Oct. 18, no one has been charged with murder or any other assaultive crime in connection with the Charity Lodge shootout.\n\nOfficials ask that those with information call the Muskegon Police Department at (231) 724-6750 or Silent Observer at (231) 722-7463.\n\nA new Silent Observer system also allows anonymous tips via text, by texting MKGTIP plus your tip to 274637 (CRIMES).

And their victims, though manhandled and bound during the robbery, found the assailants surprisingly personable, if not criminally adept.\n\nPolice said the burglary unfolded around 6 p.m. Wednesday in the 1300 block of Sixth Street. Police said a man knocked at the front door of a newly renovated Victorian home and asked the 68-year-old woman who answered if \"Brian\" was home. She told the man nobody by that name lived there, and the man left.\n\nThree men, one armed with a handgun, forced their way into a home in the 1300 block of Sixth Street, binding and robbing the homeowners, police said. (Google Maps)\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, there was another knock at the door. This time, according to the homeowners, the same man and two accomplices -- one armed with a handgun -- shoved their way past the woman into the house. Using dog leashes found in the home, the men tied up the woman and her 71-year-old husband. They ordered the couple into a first-floor study and began filling a bag with valuables, including a handgun, cameras, cell phones and iPad tablets.\n\n\"They spoke Spanish to each other,\" said the husband, who is not being identified by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune because he is a victim of a crime. \"But the one that talked to us, he was actually very nice and reassuring. He told us not to look at them. And he kept saying, 'Where's the money? Where's the money?'\n\n\"I told him, 'The only money I had was in my wallet, and you already took that.'\"\n\nThe ordeal was over in about five minutes, the husband said. And though the couple was shaken, they were not injured. NOPD Officer Justin Brown responded to the call. And once he learned what was taken, the electronic chase was on, using a popular free app as an investigative tool.\n\nThe husband told police one of the devices stolen had been plugged in, and was only in \"sleep\" mode. Using the free \"Find My iPhone\" app installed on the device, investigators began tracing the movement of the stolen items to a location in Fat City. New Orleans police coordinated with officers of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, and tracked down three men matching the suspects' descriptions leaving a black Ford Mustang in the 3300 block of Edenborn Avenue. Next to a nearby dumpster, police and deputies also found a duffel bag containing some of the couple's stolen items.\n\nPolice booked Luis Guevara, 20; Kevin Aguilar, 23; and 22-year-old Orlyn Izaguirre each on two counts of armed robbery and one count of aggravated burglary. Police said the woman recognized one of the men as someone who had previously done renovation work at the home as a contractor or painter, NOPD Lt. Frank Young said.\n\nNew Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas praised his officers' quick response and ingenuity, noting that electronic tracking capabilities of phones, tablets, laptop computers and cars continues to aid in apprehension of thieves.\n\n\"(These officers) did what I would classify as amazing police work,\" Serpas said. \"In short order, three very dangerous men were taken off the streets. ...

He was shot in the foot by enemy fire that killed another member of his unit.\n\nThe wound placed him on crutches and in a wheelchair for more than four months, according to the request. He lost part of a toe and was awarded the Purple Heart for his service.\n\nZillmer was among a handful of soldiers who sued after being denied disability benefits from the Army. A federal judge upheld the Army\u2019s decision in September.\n\nThe benefit denial was part of a supplemental insurance policy available to service members that covers any type of disability that prevents soldiers from performing basic daily activities, even if just temporarily.\n\nAccording to his lawsuit, the Army denied his temporary disability claim in part because the nurse who helped treat him failed to check boxes on paperwork indicating whether he was personally familiar with the limitations that the injury had created.\n\nZillmer argued, among other things, that when evacuated half way around the world following a combat injury, the treating physician is unavailable to provide the kind of paperwork the Army was requiring.\n\nA neighbor, Chad Martini, said Zillmer moved in to an address north of Gonzaga University about a year ago. Last week, Martini said he ran out of gas and Zillmer brought him a few gallons to make it home.\n\nHe tried to take Zillmer $30 to pay him back for the fuel last night, but police were outside the home and he had to leave the cash with a friend, Martini said.\n\n\u201cHe was a great guy,\u201d Martini said.\n\nSpokane County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Mark Gregory said the young man was first approached Tuesday around 7 p.m by law enforcement.

Four others had gun accidents while fiddling with and/or showing off their guns for no particular reason, four practicing at the range accidentally shot themselves or others (in one case, someone half a mile away), two accidentally shot humans while hunting, and two more accidentally shot themselves while producing weapons for what they said was defensive use.\n\nAmong the standouts were one of our two patriots who somehow forgot their constant companions and lifelines to freedom, and left them behind. In this case, a Colorado state legislator who left his loaded pistol behind in a canvas bag, underneath the table where he'd been seated for a hearing on expanding concealed carry laws, since concealed carriers are so awesome and safe and stuff.\n\nThere were a number of stories originally picked up as accidental shootings last week, but that on further examination were called into some question. Included among them, this episode from River Hills, WI, in which a man was said to have accidentally shot himself. Later, it was reported more ambiguously as a case of a man who was cleaning a gun, and then began \u201chandling it in a careless manner,\u201d How so? \"River Hills police say Gifford placed one round in the gun, and 'made random and reckless statements about the weapon and its use.'\" This resulted in a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has ruled this death a suicide. So, how do you count that one? Intentional? Russian Roulette? Accident? I don't know, so I left it out of the count.\n\nThen there was this one from Scotch Plains, NJ, in which it was reported that a man had been accidentally shot while he and a relative were cleaning a gun. No charges were initially filed. But the next day, the cops were back, and seized nearly 100 firearms from the house, and charged the shooter with aggravated assault, pointing a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. So what does that mean? They changed their minds about the circumstances? The cleaning story was a lie? I don't know.\n\nOne more, this time from Marietta Township, WI, where Boscobel Elementary School sixth grader Briar Brown shot himself at his Crawford County home. Briar had been shot with his .22 rifle, and he died the following day. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone will ever know exactly what happened; he was alone at the time,\u201d said Crawford County Sheriff Dale McCullick. \u201cWas it self-inflicted? Was he cleaning his gun? Was he going to shoot a skunk? I\u2019ve heard all those things, but none of us will ever know what happened. It\u2019s an absolute tragedy. We all know that.\u201d The only hint at anything other than this being an accident is the question of whether it was \"self-inflicted,\" which doesn't necessarily carry the implication that it was suicide. What happened? Again, we don't know. But there are stories like these every week, and we usually have to put them aside and just be resigned to never knowing what happened.\n\nThe children of GunFAIL were somewhat fewer than usual this week. Six were accidentally shot, the youngest being just 5 months old. The others were aged 3, 6, 12, 13 and 16. The kids were vastly outnumbered by those who shot themselves, as usual. But they were also outnumbered by those accidentally injured by gunfire in bars and restaurants. As I mentioned in the title, as South Carolina clears the way for carrying weapons in the state's bars (with Georgia now considering it, as well), a total of 15 were wounded just this past week in accidental discharges in bars and restaurants in Florida and Kansas, appropriately enough in establishments known as \"Shooters\" and \"Shot Time II,\" respectively.\n\nBelow the fold, last week's list.", "publish_date": "2014-02-27"}, {"text": "Clearwater police are seeking the public\u2019s help in locating the suspect in an attempted carjacking at Westfield Countryside Mall on Sunday.\n\nPolice say the armed suspect approached a 24-year-old Largo woman and her two young children after they arrived shortly after 1 p.m. between JCPenney and Macy\u2019s.\n\nThey were just outside their car when the suspect, armed with a silver or chrome handgun, pulled the slide back on the gun and demanded the vehicle, police say.\n\nThe woman pleaded for him to not take the car or hurt her or her two two preschool-age children, one of whome was in a stroller, police say.\n\nThe suspect ran off when another car pulled into a nearby parking space, police say.\n\nThe suspect, seen on surveillance video from inside the mall, is described as a black male in his mid-20s, between 5 feet 5 and 5 feet 9 with a medium build.

The three were found dead in three different rooms of the cousins' apartment.\n\nThe four Rochester men and Jesica Leonard, 25, were also charged with second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, a felony. Court records allege that police also retrieved four more pounds of marijuana and the gun believed to be the murder weapon from the apartment that Leonard shared with White, her boyfriend. Leonard and White also face charges of second-degree criminal possession of marijuana.\n\nPolice retrieved a second loaded handgun, which was hidden in the bedroom of the same apartment, according to court records. White was also charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon in City Court in connection with that gun.\n\nFederal charges were also filed Monday against Allen, Fulcott, Leonard, McFarlane and White, said U.S. Attorney William Hochul. All five were charged with felony possession with intent to distribute; White, Leonard and McFarlane were all charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking. White alone was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Marangola.\n\n\"Last week we heard from the community that the family (of the homicide victims) and public wanted answers of what happened on Chili Avenue,\" Hochul said. \"We have the weapon; we have people linked to the weapon. Now we ask the public for any and all information pertaining to the defendants we have in custody.\"\n\nAll six people were arraigned in City Court Monday and remanded to the Monroe County Jail. They are due back in City Court later this week.\n\nVFREILE@DemocratandChronicle.com\n\nTwitter.com/vfreile\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1hZeg3m", "publish_date": "2014-03-03"}, {"text": "The Philadelphia Police Department\u2019s East Detectives Division is looking to identify the suspect responsible for multiple commercial robberies in Upper Kensington and Fairhill.\n\nIncident #1:\n\nOn February 11, 2014, at 8:30pm, an unknown male entered Talento\u2019s Beauty Salon located at 3129 North Front Street and stated he was selling a 42\u2019\u2019 T.V. and would be back to show the T.V.

He told the operator he did not know who was shooting at him, or why he was being chased.\n\nThe chase crossed into Pennsylvania where the Ford Ranger, which police say was driven by Strawser, pushed Davison into the median.\n\nThe driver then got off of the exit, came back around, and found Davison stopped in the median, facing southbound traffic. He pulled up and fired multiple rounds from a .44 caliber Rossi Ranch Hand gun at Davison.\n\n\"This violent act has left a huge void in the Davison family,\" Kosheba said. \"Their loss was only further compounded by the question, 'Why did this occur?'\"\n\nDavison had no enemies, after all, and his route had changed at the last minute, lessening the likelihood he had been targeted, police say.\n\nIt appeared to be a case of road rage.\n\nWhat Davison did in his final moments, however, was give authorities a description of the pursuing truck through his 911 call, giving them something to go on in the ensuing investigation.\n\nThe investigation\n\nThe first clues came from the scene of the shooting, where police found a .44 caliber shell casing, several bullet fragments, and some blue paint left on Davison's car, Kosheba said. They also discovered an emblem from a Ford Ranger, left behind from the two vehicles striking each other.\n\nDavison's description of that truck was sent out to law enforcement in surrounding states and was disseminated to the public, too, resulting in more than 1,000 tips coming in.\n\nA break in the case wouldn't come for more than a year, but in the meantime, police had the paint found on Davison's car analyzed, revealing a distinct color used on Ford Rangers in the 1990s. Investigators cross-referenced the color to try to identify the truck and investigated hundreds of potential vehicles and interviewed many auto shop employees without success.\n\nIt was a difficult investigation, authorities say, spanning many states, and interviewing many individuals who may have seen Davison or the truck in those final hours.\n\nIt may have been frustrating at times, too, but, \"Our investigators don't get discouraged,\" State Police Cpl. Jonathan Mays said. \"We're diligent.\"\n\nThe big break came in April when police say a man named Jamie Breese came forward after he learned that Strawser had been arrested and charged with homicide in West Virginia.\n\nBreese said he and his wife had argued with Strawser the night of Davison's death more than a year prior, and Strawser had been looking for them.\n\nBreese told the police his wife knew Strawser, and the couple had a volatile history with him. As the Breeses received numerous threatening messages from Strawser that night, they left a club in Bunker Hill, West Virginia, avoiding him, and drove along the same route that Davison had been traveling, police said.\n\nMays said the tipsters did not contact the authorities until more than a year later because they did not believe Strawser was capable of such a thing.\n\n\"Once there was the homicide in West Virginia, that led them to believe that he certainly was capable of this, and that broke things open for us,\" Mays said.\n\nAnd it no longer looked like a road-rage shooting. Now, police believed it was a case of mistaken identity, and Davison may have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nThey dug in, working with police in West Virginia, and found the truck Strawser owned matched the one they had been looking for. They also learned Strawser owned a gun matching the .44-caliber shell casing left at the scene.\n\nBeyond that, Kosheba said investigators found Strawser's cellphone had been used along the route in which the shooting had occurred.\n\nDNA testing on the shell casings further revealed a partial DNA sample, which was compared with Strawser's DNA, showing the same DNA markers.\n\nAll of this evidence was presented to Franklin County District Attorney Matthew Fogal, who approved the homicide charges filed Monday against Strawser.\n\n\"The arrest of this violent individual marks another step in our pursuit of justice for the Davison family,\" Kosheba said.\n\nStrawser will likely face his West Virginia charges first, but to investigators in Pennsylvania, they say it's a relief that he is in custody.\n\nIn West Virginia, WAJR in Morgantown reported Strawser was charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of former love interest Amy Lou Buckingham, who was 38.\n\nMays said the investigation uncovered numerous other relationships Strawser had been involved in that seemed to go out of control.\n\n\"Once he fixated on a person, he was very controlling,\" Mays said. \"Once those other parties decided to go away from him, then he ratcheted it up, and we saw things like we saw in this case.\"\n\nMays added, \"He's not going to hurt anyone else.\"", "publish_date": "2015-09-22"}, {"text": "Choose the plan that\u2019s right for you.

W.L. Meeler. A short time later more than one suspect approached him as he sat in his cab. The suspects, Meeler said, appeared to have walked to the cab from the street. The driver and the suspects had a disturbance and the cab driver got out of the car. Then he was shot. He got back into his cab. The suspects left after the gunfire. It's unclear if the suspects took anything from the cab or the driver.\n\nA person who said he had seen the cab parked at the complex Thursday night noticed it parked at the same spot Friday morning. He contacted police, who were originally dispatched to the scene about a person down. Initially, it was not known how he died and it was believed he may have died from natural causes. However, Meeler said, when homicide investigators arrived, they realized he had been shot.\n\nNo gun was found at the scene.\n\nMeeler said investigators don't believe the fare the cab driver had taken to the complex was involved in the shooting.\n\nResidents in the neighborhood said the shooting was troubling to them. They said the area is usually quiet and seems safe.\n\nDavid Escarzaga said he lives a few doors down from where the shooting happened.

But, they say the note gave no indication that he intended to hurt or kill anyone else.\n\nAround 10:30 Monday night, Franklin Police say Parish took a handgun to a house on Bridlewood Drive, where he argued with his ex-girlfriend, 19-year-old Maria Davis. Davis lived in the house with her mother, Leanne Smith, her 12-year old brother and her friend, 19-year old Sarah Davidson.

After spinning the car around, Auvenshine pointed a gun in the direction of two White Settlement officers. One of the officers fired a series of rifle rounds at Auvenshine in an attempt to end the pursuit.\n\nAccording to their testimony, Auvenshine continued driving briefly before losing control again, flipping his car and attempting to flee on foot. At trial, one of the White Settlement officers testified that, concerned with the safety of his fellow officers and the general public, he fired three rifle rounds at Auvenshine, striking him at least once. Auvenshine was arrested and transported for medical care.\n\nDuring the punishment phase of the trial, Assistant District Attorneys Abby Placke and Robert DuBoise introduced judgments showing that Auvenshine had delivery of a controlled substance convictions in 2000 and again in 2007.\n\nThe sentences, which will be served concurrently, will result in Auvenshine not being eligible to be released from prison until at least the year 2036, Swain said.\n\nVisiting District Judge David Cleveland presided over the trial.\n\n\u201cAuvenshine could appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest criminal court in our State,\u201d said Assistant District Attorney Eddy Lewallen, who handled the appeal for the prosecution. \u201cHowever, they only hear capital murder cases and other cases that they determine have novel or unresolved legal issues.

Rick Beghtol were retrieving police property from Abundez-Ramirez\u2019s apartment.\n\nSpokane Superior Court arresting documents indicate Abundez-Ramirez broke into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s Barrington Apartment Complex apartment about 3 a.m. that Sunday morning, startling her roommate by standing over her bed. Abundez-Ramirez yelled at the roommate for approximately 15 minutes demanding to know where his ex-girlfriend was, offering at one point to pay the roommate \u2013 who told officers he smelled of intoxicants \u2013 to not tell anyone before leaving.\n\nThe roommate received several phone calls from Abundez-Ramirez throughout the course of the day, including from his roommate\u2019s phone after she blocked his personal cell number.\n\nCheney Police Chief John Hensley said they learned of Abundez-Ramirez\u2019s activities and after he and Cmdr.

A knife and 9mm handgun were confiscated upon a body search, and he was twice read his Miranda rights, refusing to answer questions without his attorney.\n\nBeghtol told Abundez-Ramirez it was necessary to get other department equipment issued him, and they subsequently retrieved his badge and handgun after he gave them permission to search his vehicle. The rest of the equipment was at his College Hill apartment, and after saying his roommate was home, gave Beghtol permission to enter the apartment and retrieve the uniform, ballistic vest and utility belt.\n\nOakes and Beghtol drove Abundez-Ramirez to the complex, parking out of sight of the apartment in what Oakes termed a \u201ctactical approach.\u201d Beghtol went to the apartment and knocked on the door while Oakes stood outside the vehicle, keeping the back door open in order to maintain line of sight contact with Beghtol and communicate with Abundez-Ramirez.\n\nBeghtol received no answers to his knocks. Oakes said while this was happening he looked in at Abundez-Ramirez and noticed he had slid to the passenger side of the back seat and was sitting with this handcuffed hands in front of him, \u201cquite the feat\u201d Oakes said considering the handcuffs were hinged to limit movement and Abundez-Ramirez is not a small man.\n\nOakes said he attempted to take the suspect out of the vehicle to reposition the handcuffs when Abundez-Ramirez attacked him.\n\n\u201cHe lunged face to face,\u201d Oakes said. \u201cHe started going for my gun.\u201d\n\nBoth men hit the pavement as Oakes struck Abundez-Ramirez repeatedly in the face while pulling on the handgun.

Hensley added that Oakes has received training in weapons retention.\n\n\u201cHis plan was suicide by cop,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cHe knew how to get the gun out, but he picked the wrong cop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fight was so quick and so violent,\u201d Oakes added. \u201cFortunately we didn\u2019t have to oblige him of his wish.

The judge also called Chanla\u2019s fellow gang members cowards for taking advantage of people to promote their violent lifestyle.\n\nThe shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. Jan. 16, 2014, on Fresno Street, south of Belmont Avenue near downtown.\n\nDuring Chanla\u2019s trial in August, prosecutor Noelle Pebet said the police Violent Crime Impact Team was looking for a wanted man at 403 N. Fresno St. when Asian Boyz gang members Wilson Khounvixay and Chanla left the home.\n\nThe shooting happened Jan. 16, 2014, on Fresno Street, south of Belmont Avenue near downtown Fresno.\n\nAccording to Pebet, a witness heard Khounvixay tell Chanla, \u201cBuck at them, foo, buck at them.\u201d Pebet said the phrase means shoot at the officers. Uniformed officers Timothy Sullivan and Jarite Gueringer were then hit with flying glass after Chanla fired five shots at the patrol car\u2019s windshield.\n\nAfter the shooting, Khounvixay was arrested after officers found him hiding under a car. Police arrested Chanla a few days later after getting a tip that he was hiding in an apartment on the 500 block of North Orchard Avenue. Pebet said police found a semi-automatic handgun hidden in a television inside the apartment. Ballistics showed the gun was the one used to shoot at police, she said.\n\nDefense attorney Greg Gross argued that Chanla was not guilty by reason of insanity because he has an IQ of 66, which is extremely low intelligence. Gross also said Chanla didn\u2019t have a normal life: his parents moved to North Carolina and abandoned him in Fresno, leaving him homeless and depending on gang members to give him a place to sleep and eat.\n\nIn addition, Chanla once stayed in the hospital for a month after suffering a broken leg and concussion, Gross said.\n\nIn August, a jury ruled Chanla shot at two Fresno police officers for the benefit of a criminal street gang.\n\nCourt records say Khounvixay, then 29, stood trial in August 2015 without Chanla because Chanla\u2019s mental ability had been called into question. During Khounvixay\u2019s trial, he testified that he barely knew Chanla and had no clue he was going to shoot at police. Once gunfire erupted, Khounvixay said he ducked for cover.\n\nThe jury was unable to convict Khounvixay of several charges, including attempted murder and assault with a firearm. To avoid a retrial, Khounivaxy pleaded no contest in October 2015 to assault with a firearm and was later sentenced to six years in prison, court records say.\n\nIn August, a different jury found Chanla guilty of attempted murder and assault with a firearm.

On Friday, he had filed a police report against the shooter because Peterson was harassing his daughter at the McDonald's she worked at, reported the New York Post.\n\nPeterson and several other men flirted with Pizarro's 18 year-old daughter at the fast food restaurant located on Knickerbocker Avenue. Her family reported that after the girl turned them down, one of the men threw a milkshake in her face.\n\n\"They were making advances and teasing her and harassing her,\" said Ivette Miranda, a family friend. \"She called her dad, and he went there, to the McDonald's, and called the cops. He filed a police report right there.\"\n\nThe manager of the restaurant said Pizzaro warned the men to leave his daughter alone. \"Those guys are bad men. They wanted to get back at Rolando,\" Miranda said, according to the New York Post.\n\nAmil's sister, Lisa, said \"Melody was shot in the knee. She'll be OK. I can't believe they would shoot into a street full of people. This is just over a girl or something. It's just so senseless.\"\n\nResidents and community leaders are requesting stricter gun laws.

Investigators did not immediately know why the pair were at the gas station, nor where they were headed.\n\nAccording to Palmieri, Martinez did not have a permanent residence and appeared to be homeless. It was unknown if his young child, who was in his custody at the time of the killing, was also floating from place to place.\n\nNo suspects have been identified in the shooting, Palmieri said.

Prosecutors will decide whether to seek the death penalty against Williams, who was embarking on a brutal crime spree when he killed the girl, investigators said.\n\nWilliams is also accused of killing a man who he attempted to rob during a dice game in Berkeley in September, authorities said.\n\n\u201cSome crimes rock the agency and the community; they affect us forever. This is one,\u201d said Oakland police Assistant Chief Paul Figueroa. \u201cKilling an 8-year-old is as despicable as it gets.\u201d\n\nAlameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley said the suspects went to the Wilson Avenue apartment intent on killing someone they believed was responsible for Davis\u2019 killing and \u201cdid not care\u201d who was inside when they opened fire.\n\nCourt documents show the suspects knew that their intended target\u2019s children and their mother lived in the Dimond District apartment. Carradine was staying at her friend\u2019s house.\n\nWilliams, after orchestrating the killing with Carroll, rang the doorbell at 11:18 p.m.; as soon as Alaysha\u2019s friend, a 7-year-old girl, opened the door, he started shooting, O\u2019Malley said. The bullets pierced the apartment\u2019s metal gate and hit four of the five people inside. Alaysha was killed and her friend, a 4-year-old boy and their 64-year-old grandmother were wounded.\n\nCarroll was arrested Sept. 27 in Houston, and Williams was arrested Sept. 8 by Berkeley police.\n\nWilliams and Laquana Nuno are also charged with the Sept. 8 killing of Anthony Medearis in the 1400 block of Eighth Street in West Berkeley. Williams was shooting dice with Medearis and others when he decided to rob Medearis, according to court papers.\n\nWilliams shot Medearis, and in the process, a bullet fragment struck Williams\u2019 7-year-old nephew in the face, documents show. Nuno agreed to be a getaway driver for Williams, and fled police after Williams jumped out of her car, authorities said.\n\nWilliams was arrested later that night, found hiding in a shed, according to police.\n\nCarroll and three other suspected gang members \u2014 Joseph Connors, Emando Roos and Travon Wilson \u2014 were also charged with conspiring to murder two men who Carroll believed had disrespected him and his brother, authorities said. Information developed during the course of the investigation into Alaysha\u2019s death allowed police to prevent the killing, including when some of the men were stalking the targets at an unnamed Oakland nightclub, authorities said.\n\nNuno, Connors, Roos and Wilson were arrested Saturday after police served search warrants in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference announcing the arrests, O\u2019Malley said the killing of Alaysha \u201cshocked all of us\u201d and showed the \u2018disregard for human life\u201d that gang members have.\n\nShe singled out Oakland police homicide investigator Officer Rob Rosin, who headed the case, for bringing it to a successful conclusion.\n\nMayor Jean Quan said Alaysha\u2019s killing \u201creally broke my heart\u201d and said she hopes the arrests \u201cwill send a signal\u201d that violent crime will not be tolerated.\n\nAlaysha, whose family called her \u201cLadybug,\u201d would have started third grade at Fruitvale Elementary School in August.

Another shooting late Thursday morning made it one of the most violent days in East Oakland in recent weeks.\n\nIn the 4 p.m. shooting, two men exchanged fire with one other man.\n\nOne of the men in the duo was struck by gunfire and fell onto a median while running away, police said. His accomplice ran to a nearby getaway vehicle, and a man in the car helped pull the wounded man inside. A few minutes later, they stopped the car and left the injured man at 96th Avenue and Sunnyside Street; he was taken to a hospital, where he later died. Police did not immediately identify him.\n\nThe other man in the gunbattle was also struck by gunfire and boarded an AC Transit bus stopped nearby on Bancroft Avenue. A bullet hit the windshield of the bus during the gunbattle, but no one on the bus was injured.\n\nThe bus continued down Bancroft and stopped at 82nd Avenue, where the wounded man got off the bus, police said. He was transported to a hospital with a non-life-threatening injury.\n\nPolice did not release names, ages or cities of residence for anyone wounded in the shootings.\n\nEarlier in the day, two men were wounded \u2014 one in the leg and one in the arm \u2014 in a drive-by shooting at 11:15 a.m. in the 9000 block of Thermal Street but managed to get to the 8900 block of MacArthur Boulevard, where police and paramedics responded.\n\nThe black car used in that shooting and the people in the vehicle match the description of the getaway car and the people involved in the shootout later in the day, police said.

After the hearing, the attempted murder charges were lowered to aggravated assault with a firearm, and Silva will be held without bond until a further court date.According to the affidavit read by presiding Judge John Hurley during the proceedings, Silva and his wife separated back in 2012, but had an incident just last week that brought in the police. On Jan. 30, Ms. Silva called 911 after a domestic altercation, and told police that Thiago pulled a gun on her, put it in her mouth, and told her he was going to kill her.No further incident came that day, but on Wednesday of this week, Feb. 5, Mr. Silva sent a threatening text message to Ms. Silva.The judge relayed the paraphrased text message, which read, \"I'm going to f*** you up and you're going to die. I'm going to hire someone to kill you and I'm going to move my girlfriend into the home.\"On Thursday night, Feb. 6, Ms. Silva was training at Popovitch's gym when Mr. Silva pulled up in his vehicle, honking his horn to gain attention. When she approached, he was allegedly intoxicated, and pulled out a black Glock handgun, pointing it at her through the door.Silva allegedly then threatened, \"You have ten seconds to bring Pablo outside, and if he does not come out, I'm going to go in the gym and start shooting everyone.\"There were 25 adult students in the center at the time of the incident. Popovitch exited the building and approached in an attempt to diffuse the situation, at which time Silva threatened to kill both Popovitch and Ms. Silva.Popovitch then ran inside to call the police, Silva fled the scene back to his home, and subsequently engaged in a drunken stand off with the police before finally being brought into custody.Judge Hurley did not find sufficient probably cause for attempted murder, as he cited numerous cases where threats were made with a gun in a domestic violence situation and those individuals were not charged with attempted murder.The judge initially set bond for Silva at $2.5 million on the four charges he's facing, but then retracted that bond after further discussion due to the State's Attorney's concern that Silva was a further danger to his wife.\"The court is very concerned if you were released from custody that you would approach your wife again, confront your wife again, and you would bring great harm to her or kill her,\" Judge Hurley told Silva during the hearing, adding, \"The court has no doubt that you could kill any and all of these people even without a gun.\"The decision was bolstered by the belief that Silva could be a flight risk to his home country of Brazil. As Brazil does not extradite their own citizens to the U.S., him leaving for his home country would effectively end the case for the prosecution.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Thursday has been declared a First Alert Weather Day because of the potential for strong straight line winds and the chance of an isolated tornado.

Dale Phillips said witness accounts and physical evidence have led investigators to believe that the two men were racing each other down the southbound lanes of the interstate at high speeds when contact was made between their two vehicles.\n\n\n\nPhillips said there is no evidence to suggest the contact was intentional, but it was enough to destabilize both vehicles and the men wrecked into each other then into the concrete median dividing the interstate before coming to a stop near Exit 100, just outside of Lake View, Ala.\n\n37-year-old Roderick Dale Washington, Jr. is charged with capital murder for the shooting death of a 40-year-old Tuscaloosa man.Investigators say the two were racing down I-20 at high speeds, collided and wrecked their vehicles before Washington shot the other driver. (Tuscaloosa County Jail)\n\nAfter the accident, the suspect exited his now-totaled Chevrolet Impala and walked over to his victim's wrecked Nissan Altima. Sgt. Phillips says evidence suggests he shot the other driver one time while his victim was still in his vehicle. The wounded man, 40-year-old\n\nFrederick Lee Blakely\n\n, got out of his car but collapsed on the ground and was found dead on the scene.\n\nWhen Lake View police officers and Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly after, they found 37-year-old\n\nRoderick Dale Washington, Jr.\n\n, the driver of the wrecked Impala. Washington suffered minor injuries in the crash and was taken to DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa for treatment.\n\nSince then, Phillips said evidence and witness reports gathered gave investigators reason to charge Washington with capital murder. He was taken in to custody and booked in the Tuscaloosa County Jail, where he will be held without bond.\n\nPhillips said there was no indication that the men knew each other before they began racing on the interstate Thursday night. He said it was unlikely that the two had a predetermined start and finish line for their race and the contest of speed was probably a spontaneous one initiated on the road.\n\nPhillips said the car accident was the sole result of the high rate of speed and carelessness of the drivers, and the state's recent winter weather woes did not come into play.\n\nWashington has three speeding tickets against him on record in the Alabama courts system, the most recent written in 2006. He has also had a pistol he was not licensed to carry seized by the Homewood Police Department in 2009, but his court records don't show a history of violence in the state.\n\nTraffic was stopped on I-20/59's southbound lanes for a few hours after the shooting as investigators combed through evidence on the scene and interviewed witnesses. Vehicles were backed up for miles, and Phillips apologized for that, but said the investigation had to be done on the scene and it had to be done thoroughly.", "publish_date": "2014-01-31"}, {"text": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Webb, 29, has not been accused of shooting anyone during the apparent gunfight.\n\n\n\nShortly after 1 a.m. that Monday morning, an argument near the intersection of Second Avenue South and South Main Street turned into a shootout. Five people were shot, including 26-year-old Cassandra Hampton, who clung to life for four days before succumbing to her wounds at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center.\n\n\n\nAt the time, a Seattle Police Department spokesman described the incident as an argument between two men \"that rapidly spun out of control.\" At least two people who were involved fired guns during the closing-time shootout.\n\n\n\nOfficers responding to the scene found Hampton shot in the face. Four others thought to have been shot during the gunfight - three men aged 24, 20 and 19, and a 22-year-old woman - arrived at area hospitals in the hours afterward.\n\n\n\nA woman driving away from the shooting scene crashed into a King County Sheriff's Office patrol car rushing toward the area.

The detective noted that Webb's identical twin does not have matching fingerprints; the brother was incarcerated at the time of the shooting.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the pistol showed it had fired a bullet recovered from another car that had fled the shooting scene, the detective continued. The occupants of that car are rivals to the East Union Street Hustlers, a central Seattle street gang to which police say Webb belongs.\n\n\n\nCourt records don't indicate that any witnesses saw Webb fire the pistol during the shootout. Investigators contend mobile phone data and witness statements show Webb was in the car during the gunfight, and fled immediately.\n\n\n\nWebb had been scheduled to meet with his probation officer hours after the shooting.

Flames surged 100 feet into the air and illuminated the forested, rural landscape where the nearest house was about one-quarter mile away and not in danger of igniting, authorities said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the three-bedroom house, which was for sale for $389,900 along with 172 scenic acres, was a smoldering pile of rubble. The property included several ponds and had been operated as a campground by the homeowner's parents, the property's listing agent said.\n\nAuthorities had been to the house at the end of 75 Saddlemire Road at least a half-dozen times in the past year or so for domestic disturbances, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified.\n\nIn January 2012, troopers responded to a complaint that Fortuin was agitated and had threatened to shoot people, authorities said.\n\nFortuin, 49, owner of Knox Country Builder, was charged with third-degree arson, a felony, which carries a 1 to 15 year prison sentence. He did not have a lawyer with him when he pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Thursday in Knox Town Court before Town Justice James Corigliano. Fortuin left the courtroom, but was brought back a short time later to be arraigned on a second charge of obstructing firefighters, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of one year. After both arraignments, Corigliano told Fortuin, \"Good luck to you sir.\" Fortuin was sent to the Albany County Jail.\n\nFortuin had been in his Silverado pickup truck since around 9:45 p.m. Wednesday on the rural property after he called 911 and said he was armed and willing to shoot whomever ventured near the house, authorities said.\n\nWhen firefighters from the Knox Volunteer Fire Department arrived a short while later, they had been alerted to the dangerous situation and stayed back from a raging fire that consumed the century-old farmhouse that had been in Fortuin's family for generations.\n\nFirefighters were mindful of the burst of gunfire that met firefighters when they arrived at a house and car fire burning on the shores of Lake Ontario two days before Christmas 2012 in Webster, N.Y., outside Rochester. It was a trap set by a deranged homeowner and ex-convict who killed two firefighters and injured two others in the chaotic scene before the shooter killed himself.\n\nThe troopers and sheriff's deputies also hung back Wednesday night, uncertain where the gunman was on the property and whether he had prepared an ambush, or if he might turn the weapon on himself if they tried to approach. Fortuin spoke by cellphone with a trooper who was a relative and one of the firefighters on the scene also was related to Fortuin, authorities said, noting such connections were not unusual in the tight-knit Hilltowns.\n\nAt around 4 a.m., an outbuilding burst into flames and the situation grew more strained. At daybreak, a State Police helicopter arrived and circled overhead. Fortuin was located in his pickup truck in a field a short distance from the farmhouse, State Police said.\n\nAt around 6:30 a.m., after troopers saw Fortuin point a handgun at himself when he got bogged down in deep snow as he tried to drive away, the SWAT teams advanced and surrounded Fortuin's truck. Troopers rode in a Bear Cat armored vehicle and sheriffs' SWAT team members filled an armored Humvee and a military surplus 18-ton Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, or MRAP, a military surplus vehicle with gun turrets and bulletproof glass used in the Iraq War.\n\nAuthorities said Fortuin dropped the handgun, a 9 millimeter, and gave himself up to troopers without a struggle at about 7 a.m.\n\nThe edgy situation immediately recalled the massacre of firefighters in Webster, N.Y., which prompted specific local training in response, said John Layton, a volunteer firefighter who was among seven firefighters who responded with two firetrucks from Knox Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\"We were very concerned given what had happened and we were focused on our training,\" Layton said. \"We got additional information that the man was distraught and that the fire might have been intentiionally set.\"\n\nWhen firefighters saw the farmhouse burning heavily and recently cut trees pulled across to block the road, they recalled their training and retreated. \"There was no indiciation anyone was hurt or inside the house and we were very concerned about the situation and our own safety,\" Layton said. They backed the firetrucks up a safe distance away from the fire and stayed on the scene as troopers and sheriff's deputies arrived.\n\nFirefighters and law enforcement officials conferred and decided that residents on Saddlemire Road were far enough away and did not need to be evacuated. They were told to take shelter in their homes, Layton said.\n\nLayton, who was off-duty as a captain with the sheriff's department, eventually spoke with Fortuin briefly by cellphone.\n\n\"He led us to believe he was still in the area, and based on what he said it was clear we should stay back,\" Layton said.\n\nLayton stayed on the scene until about 4 a.m., when he went home. He later got an update on the outcome.\n\n\"The State Police made some smart moves and they worked very well with the sheriff's SWAT team,\" Layton said. \"It was very fortunate it ended safely, with no injuries to anyone.\"\n\nTroy Miller, owner of C.M. Fox Real Estate, knows the family and listed the property for sale. He met Fortuin and his estranged wife, Andrea Fortuin, as he drew up the paperwork and was aware that they were going through a bitter divorce. \"I didn't dig in too far,\" Miller said. He said the couple had been together for at least 10 years, and possibly longer. He had not yet seen the fiery destruction.\n\n\"It's very fortunate for everybody involved that nobody got hurt in that fire,\" Miller said.\n\nKnox Town Supervisor Michael Hammond said he knew Fortuin for many years and expressed surprise at his arrest.\n\nAndrea Fortuin is owner of Orenda Yoga & Healing Arts, with studios in Schenectady and Guilderland Center. She is a certified yoga therapist and meditation coach. She could not be reached for comment.\n\n\"Please respect what we are going through is personal and painful,\" she posted on her Facebook page. \"Love and prayers are what is needed, not gossip.\"\n\nMore than two dozen people posted comments, which ranged from \"Big hugs and endless energy\" to \"I am reaching out to the universe for a positive outcome.\"\n\nBob Gardinier contributed. pgrondahl@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5623 \u2022 @PaulGrondahl", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Officers spotted Hammond and another male near the vehicle, and when they approached the two men, Hammond failed to listen to their orders.
