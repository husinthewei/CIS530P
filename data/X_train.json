At one point his hand reaches down, his right hand behind his back, and then he produces a weapon, brings it up, both hands in a shooting stance parallel to the ground, pointing it at the officer,\" Bruegger said. \"The officer immediately starts firing, and strikes the suspect.\"Police said the officer fired at least six times.Eyewitness News spoke to a 63-year-old man who saw the shooting from his front yard. He says the suspect did shoot at the officer and the officer had to protect himself.\"It's unfortunate the officer is placed in the position but when a suspect points a weapon at the officer, the officer really has no choice but to defend himself,\" said Bruegger.The officer, 40 years old and a 13-year veteran of Pasadena PD, was not hurt. He has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard after officer-involved shootings. A Harris County grand jury will review the case.Police said Saavedra's gun was found next to his body at the scene.", "publish_date": "2018-03-30"}, {"text": "Info Search State Alaska Alabama Arkansas American Samoa Arizona California Colorado Connecticut District of Columbia Delaware Florida Georgia Guam Hawaii Iowa Idaho Illinois Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Massachusetts Maryland Maine Michigan Minnesota Missouri Northern Mariana Islands Mississippi Montana North Carolina North Dakota Nebraska New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico Nevada New York Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas United States Minor Outlying Islands Utah Virginia Virgin Islands Vermont Washington Wisconsin West Virginia Wyoming Field Office Albany Albuquerque Anchorage Atlanta Baltimore Birmingham Boston Buffalo Charlotte Chicago Cincinnati Cleveland Columbia El Paso Dallas Denver Detroit Honolulu Houston Indianapolis Jackson Jacksonville Louisville Kansas City Knoxville Little Rock Las Vegas Los Angeles Milwaukee Miami Memphis Minneapolis Mobile Newark New Haven New Orleans New York Norfolk Oklahoma City Omaha Philadelphia Phoenix Pittsburgh Portland Richmond Sacramento Salt Lake City San Francisco San Antonio San Juan Seattle Springfield St. Louis San Diego Tampa Washington Male Female Armed and Dangerous Serial Reward Reset Search Featured Bank Robber April 18, 2018 Delta, Pennsylvania UNKNOWN BANK ROBBER Approximately 5'7\", Male, White, Thin Build, The subject had a light mustache and scruffy facial stubble.

The threat was reported to Whitmore Lake Public Schools, which in turn informed police.\n\n\"He understands the severity of the charges,\" said Perks' Ypsilanti-based attorney, Marsha Kraycir. \"Thank goodness no one was hurt.\"\n\nPolice did recover a firearm at the Northfield Estates residence on Jade Lane where Perks was living, Wagner said.\n\nWagner said there wasn't a specific building targeted.

Superintendent Tom DeKeyser said privacy laws prevent him from commenting on it.\n\nHe did post a response to the arraignments on the school's website that addressed whether any of the students involved would be allowed back to school, however.\n\n\"An obvious question many students and parents have about the incident is 'Will the students involved be allowed back to school?'\" DeKeyser wrote in the statement. \"It is a fair question. I can only respond in generalities to this because the rights of all students are the same relative to releasing information in their records - it's private. That being said, it is extremely rare to allow individuals access to a building for any purpose if they participated in substantially disrupting the school.\"\n\nDeKeyser also provided this statement to MLive.com: \"This unfortunate incident tested many of our resources and we passed all of them, so far. The next test is how we grow to become better at preventing behaviors that result in threats of violence and, perhaps, the identification of warning signs which could preempt them. We have a great partnership with our local police and fire/EMT force in Northfield Twp.

A preliminary examination is scheduled for April 3 in both, too.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been corrected. An original version said the 16-year-old had been charged as a juvenile.

He said the resident at 124 Myrtle Ave., a 22-year-old man, told police the men knocked on the door, and upon opening, threatened him and a 47-year-old male guest with a firearm, pushing their way in and stealing an Xbox and a Playstation gaming system and more than $100 cash before fleeing the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a report written by Officer Christopher Bellofatto included with court documents, one suspect had brandished a black pistol while the other had a silver pistol.\n\nBellofatto said he observed a man walking in the vicinity of 46 Myrtle Ave. who was wearing a dark-green camouflage jacket and pants, fitting the description of one of the suspects, and called Benjamin Kalinowski for backup. When Bellofatto stopped him and tried to search him, Comeau became agitated and uncooperative and allegedly yelled obscenities and threats at the officers, the report states.\n\nComeau then allegedly pushed the officers to the ground, causing lacerations to Bellofatto's right palm. During the struggle, Comeau also allegedly elbowed Kalinowski in the head.\n\nMills came running down the street and screamed at police, allegedly interfering with her son's arrest, leading to her own arrest.\n\nDuring booking, Comeau was allegedly found to be in possession of 15 tied-off baggies containing a white substance believed to be cocaine, a small amount of marijuana, a small digital scale and a knife, Fossa said.\n\nFossa said police made observations at 124 Myrtle Ave. that have led to an ongoing investigation, which will include vetting what, if any, relationship exists between the victim and the suspects in the case.\n\nComeau is due back in court March 18.\n\nFollow Alana Melanson at facebook.com/alanasentinel or on Twitter @alanamelanson.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "publish_date": "2014-01-31"}, {"text": "1 shot during botched robbery in Montrose area\n\nA man was shot during a possible robbery attempt on Barnard.

Deonta Sanchez pled guilty to Attempted Robbery First Degree, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, and Conspiracy Second Degree in a case prosecuted by Deputy Attorney General Zachary Rosen. In July 2017, an off-duty New Castle County Police officer was leaving church in the 300 Block of North Van Buren Street when he was attacked by Sanchez and 3 other people. Investigation suggested that the attackers knew the victim was an off-duty officer when they attempted to rob him. Sanchez punched the officer and tried to get his gun during the altercation. Sanchez faces 6 to 52 years in prison when sentenced by a Superior Court judge in June. DOJ social worker Courtney Cochran and paralegal Jess Ascione worked on the case, and Matt Geiser of the Wilmington Police Department was the chief investigating officer.\n\nA former member of the Only My Brothers (OMB) gang pled guilty to drug and weapons charges, along with violating his probation on previous Gang Participation, Carrying a Concealed Deadly Weapon, and Aggravated Menacing convictions. In January 2018, police arrested Stephan Minus, 18, of Wilmington, when he tried to flee from the probation officers doing a home visit. A search of Minus\u2019s home turned up drugs and a loaded semi-automatic handgun. Minus pled guilty to Drug Dealing Heroin and Possession of a Firearm by a Person Prohibited and the probation violation. A Superior Court judge sentenced Minus to 5 years in prison, followed by 18 months of probation. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney prosecuted the case.\n\nA 38-year old habitual offender faces at least 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to Attempted Rape Second Degree and Assault Second Degree. In April 2017, Joseph Snow of New Castle approached a woman sitting on the ground at a bus stop in the 800 of North King Street in Wilmington, and attempted to force her to perform a sex act on him. When the woman refused, he began to choke her and punch her in the face. The assault continued until the crew of an off-duty ambulance that was driving by saw and stopped the attack. Snow, considered a habitual offender due to past convictions on weapons, rioting, and reckless endangering charges, faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced by a Superior Court judge in July. Deputy Attorney General Jenna Milecki prosecuted the case, Lisa Rapko was the social worker, and Jayna Quillen was the paralegal.\n\nA plea to 6 felony charges could lead to an extended prison term for a 35-year-old Wilmington man. Deputy Attorney General Kelly Sheridan secured the plea from Brandon Brown. In early 2017, Brown stole thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of cigarettes and other items from several convenience stores throughout New Castle County. Brown pled guilty to Wearing a Disguise, Aggravated Menacing, Robbery Second Degree, 2 counts of Burglary Third Degree, and Conspiracy Second Degree. Due to previous felony convictions on drug and weapons charges, a Superior Court judge will sentence Brown in June as a habitual offender to at least 10 years in prison.

No charges have been filed in connection with the homicides, Ciminelli said.\n\nFive residents of 2167 Clifford Ave. and a Greece man, however, were charged over the weekend following the search of two apartments in the building. They are facing a variety of felony drug and weapons charges in state and federal court.\n\nMarlando Allen, 34, Steve Fulcott, 21, Andre McFarlane, 34, Carlos White, 38, all of Clifford Avenue, and Ronald Jefferson, 46, of Town House Circle in Greece, all pleaded not guilty in City Court Monday to first-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a felony.

The three were found dead in three different rooms of the cousins' apartment.\n\nThe four Rochester men and Jesica Leonard, 25, were also charged with second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, a felony. Court records allege that police also retrieved four more pounds of marijuana and the gun believed to be the murder weapon from the apartment that Leonard shared with White, her boyfriend. Leonard and White also face charges of second-degree criminal possession of marijuana.\n\nPolice retrieved a second loaded handgun, which was hidden in the bedroom of the same apartment, according to court records. White was also charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon in City Court in connection with that gun.\n\nFederal charges were also filed Monday against Allen, Fulcott, Leonard, McFarlane and White, said U.S. Attorney William Hochul. All five were charged with felony possession with intent to distribute; White, Leonard and McFarlane were all charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking. White alone was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Marangola.\n\n\"Last week we heard from the community that the family (of the homicide victims) and public wanted answers of what happened on Chili Avenue,\" Hochul said. \"We have the weapon; we have people linked to the weapon.

He also served a year in 2007 for possession and sale of cocaine and has county arrest records dating back to 2004.\n\nMore recently, Roberts was arrested on three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in October 2016 and for domestic battery and drugs in August 2009. He was not prosecuted on the assault charge.\n\nThursday's standoff began after police responded to a domestic dispute at 8:12 p.m. Earlier in the day, police responded to reports of a man who had attempted to strike a store employee at the Bethune Village Market, 835 Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune Blvd.\n\nThe officer who responded to that call reported that he made contact with a man and issued verbal commands, but the suspect \"began to pull on the handle of a firearm from his right front pocket,\" the report stated.\n\nThe suspect, later identified as Roberts, told police \"I got eight shots,\" and \"I'm ready to die today, let's get it,\" before pulling a long gun out of his vehicle.\n\nAttempts to talk Roberts down failed.\n\nPolice said Roberts fled in a black Chevy Equinox. Another officer spotted and attempted to stop the vehicle, but the Roberts failed to stop and pursuit was terminated at the intersection of Mason Avenue and Pinewood Street, the report stated.\n\nDuring a subsequent investigation at the store, during which officers reviewed security footage, a domestic violence call was placed by Ethel Jackson who said her nephew had threatened her with a rifle.\n\nStreets were blocked while SWAT and hostage negotiators attempted to communicate with Roberts, who police described as having a \"violent history and is currently in an agitated state.\"\n\nThe Daytona Beach Police Department is involved in a standoff with a suspect that is armed with a long gun at 1401 Forrest Avenue.

Roberts' grandmother, who died last May, is the listed owner of the home where the standoff occurred at 1401 Forest Ave.\n\nShe said that on Thursday Roberts had advised her was moving out, began to collect his belongings and then \u201cexited his bedroom holding a long-barreled shotgun with both hands and a revolver sticking out of his right front pocket,\u201d the report stated.\n\nJackson told police that Roberts said, \u201cI feel like blowing your brains out,\u201d before leaving the house, but said she does not want to press charges.\n\nA .22-caliber revolver and 12-gauge shotgun were recovered by police.\n\nRoberts was also charged with fleeing and eluding police and driving on a suspended or revoked license.

Jones, 25, was convicted of attempted second-degree murder and three counts of illegal firearm possession on Wednesday (Aug. 26, 2015) by an Orleans Parish jury. Jones still faces a federal trial on juvenile sex trafficking charges set for Oct. 5.\n\n(Courtesy of Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office)\n\nAn accused Memphis pimp was convicted of attempted second-degree murder and three gun violations Wednesday (Aug. 26) after an Orleans Parish jury deliberated for about 90 minutes.\n\nBy an 11-1 vote, the jury found Timothy T. Jones guilty of attempting to murder a man shot twice in a Gentilly home in February 2014. As a repeat offender, Jones faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 4 by Criminal District Court Judge Karen Herman.\n\nJones, 25, is awaiting a federal jury trial scheduled for Oct. 5 to answer an eight-count indictment alleging interstate trafficking of juvenile girls for the purposes of sex and prostitution. Authorities allege that Jones drugged, beat and intimidated two girls age 16 and 17 to provide him income through prostitution.\n\nInvestigators described Jones as a pimp who also goes by the names \"Lucci,\" \"King Lucci\" and \"Lucci Loco.\"\n\nThe two-day trial was not without challenges for Orleans Parish prosecutors Taylor Anthony and Bonycle Thornton. The shooting victim, who was left without feeling in his lower extremities because of a bullet lodged in his spine, refused to testify against Jones. Prosecutors said the victim was another alleged pimp, who angered Jones by taking his clothing from a hotel room after Jones was arrested on weapons charges on Feb. 11, 2014.\n\nFederal agents and NOPD officers raided that hotel room in the 300 block of St. Joseph Street in the Warehouse District on Feb. 11, 2014, seeking to arrest Christopher Williams, a third alleged pimp who was wanted on sex trafficking and prostitution allegations.\n\nWhile searching for Williams, police said they found a pistol and an AK-47 rifle in the closet of a room registered to Jones. Because Jones had a previous felony robbery conviction in Tennessee, he was barred from possessing firearms and arrested on suspicion of illegal weapons possession.\n\nJones posted bond within days, but not before threatening the man who took his clothing in a recorded jailhouse call, prosecutors said. Six days after his arrest for weapons poession, Jones shot the victim at a home in the 2500 block of Gladiolus Street, police said.\n\nProsecutors said Jones fled back to Memphis after the shooting, violating terms of his bond on the New Orleans weapons arrests. Jones was captured in Tennessee and extradited back to Louisiana in April 2014.\n\nWhile jailed, Jones used a contraband phone to speak with Williams, admitting he shot the third pimp who made off with his clothes, prosecutors said. But when Williams was subpoenaed to testify Wednesday, he refused to utter a word from the witness stand. Judge Herman found Williams in contempt of court and sentenced him to six months in Orleans Parish Prison to run consecutive to his other sentences.\n\nJones was supposed to have gone on trial May 27. That date had to be reset after Jones was beaten and stabbed in the lower left side of his back inside Orleans Parish Prison on the night before jury selection was to begin.

Bond was set at $20,000 and a preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 25.\n\nMiddleton, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend, a top administrator at the Cuyahoga County Community Mental Health Board, is accused of firing at least one shot at the woman out of the passenger seat of his nephew\u2019s car on Cedar Road.\n\nMiddleton, reports say, is the uncle of the woman\u2019s children and was riding in the passenger seat with the father of the woman\u2019s child. One of the bullets struck the hood of her car, reports say.\n\nThe woman told police she was driving about 11:40 p.m. near Rossmoor Road from a friend\u2019s home, when a dark colored Chevrolet sedan pulled up next to her car. She told police she recognized the driver as Middleton\u2019s 30-year-old nephew, who is the father of her children.\n\nShe told police Middleton stuck a handgun out his window and shot at least one time at her.\n\nThe woman and the 30-year-old man exited their cars and argued in the street, reports say. The woman then drove to the police department. Investigators searched her car and noted the bullet hole.\n\nMiddleton was released from prison Jan. 15, 2013 after serving a 13-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the middle of his trial. In December, Middleton won a pro se appeal in the Eighth District Court of Appeals that allowed him to be released from probation.\n\nHe was originally sentenced to five years on probation following his release, but the common pleas judge sentenced him to \u201cthe maximum allowable\u201d time on probation.

She was the mother of two of Middleton\u2019s children and was an impeccable dresser, which helped detectives at the time see through evidence Middleton tried to plant to make it look like a car jacking.\n\nArchives say she was wearing a blue suit at the time and Middleton put green shoes in the trunk with her.

Morris had been charged with first degree murder, but his trial ended in a hung jury, and prosecutors offered him the manslaughter plea in order to avoid a re-trial that would have been emotionally difficult for Corey's family. Morris is now serving a 17-year prison sentence.\n\nA co-conspirator in the killing, Mallory McCann, was inside Corey\u2019s residence when the two men broke into the house. She had sent text messages to Fernandez at 3 a.m. to let him know the home\u2019s front door was unlocked, according to evidence at Morris' trial. McCann is now serving a 15-year prison sentence after a January plea agreement on robbery with a firearm.\n\nMcCann testified at Morris' trial, saying that Morris and Fernandez planned to steal drugs and money from Corey. McCann testified that she heard Morris and Fernandez discussing later how Fernandez had carried out the shooting.\n\nIn February 2014, Fernandez told a Naples Daily News reporter via Facebook that was not involved in the killing.\n\n\"Of the mistakes I have made, I had nothing to do with the murder of a Marine and his dog,\" wrote Fernandez.\n\nAt least one Collier County detective sat in the courtroom to observe Fernandez's weapons trial.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://nplsne.ws/2azKxRN", "publish_date": "2016-08-02"}, {"text": "HOUSTON - Houston police are investigating a road rage incident when the passenger in a car fired multiple shots at another vehicle in west Houston.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty terrifying the scariest event I\u2019ve ever gone through,\u201d Marcus Eatherly, 29, said.\n\nEatherly was headed home on Briargreen Drive around 4:30 Tuesday afternoon, when a late model, white Hyundai sedan nearly hit him while weaving through traffic.

The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.\n\n\u201cAfter the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,\u201d said Lt.

The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.\n\nThe memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it\u2019s the parking lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals. We want crime to stop in the Southwest Side, and I hope that once we close the violence will stop, but they haven\u2019t arrested people in connection to any of the shootings.\n\n\"They are cutting the tree, but not the root (of the problem).\"\n\n\n\nRELATED: Closing New Roosevelt Bar won't eliminate police calls to the area\n\nJulie Niemchick, director of the Roosevelt Park Neighborhood Association, said she sympathizes with Rivera.

He later grabbed the woman by the hair and hit her head against a vehicle before driving off, police said.The person who lived above apartment heard the disturbance and called police.This sort of violence isn't unusual in a city that reports dozens of family violence incidents a day, on average. But experts say threats like this are an indication of real danger. In fact, it is one of the questions police officers ask to determine whether the situation could turn lethal: \"Has he/she threatened to kill you or your children?\"\"If someone says they're going to kill you, take it seriously,\" Paige Flink, executive director of The Family Place shelter, has said.Experts also say it's important for witnesses or loved ones to step up if they witness such behavior, like the neighbor did in this instance. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings has tried to advertise the \"Ring the Bell\" campaign , in which someone rings a neighbor's doorbell simply to cause a distraction during an argument.\"Who fails these women?

CONTARTESI plead guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Senior United States District Judge Margaret B. Seymour accepted the plea and will impose a sentence after she has reviewed the presentence report, which will be prepared by the U.S. Probation Office.\n\nEvidence presented at the change of plea hearing established that on January 22, 2014, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), executed a federal search warrant at CONTARTESI\u2019s Rock Hill residence after learning that CONTARTESI, a prohibited felon, was in possession of firearms and ammunition. When agents arrived, CONTARTESI met them in the driveway. Agents noticed that CONTARTESI had a Glock 9mm handgun stuck in the back waistband of his pants. Agents secured the weapon and found that it had been modified to fire as an automatic weapon and was equipped with a high capacity 30-round magazine and loaded with 21 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Inside CONTARTESI\u2019s residence, agents seized a Bushmaster AR 15 .223 caliber short-barreled rifle with a high capacity magazine, a AK-47 7.62x39 caliber semi-automatic assault rifle with a high capacity magazine, a Keltec .22 caliber pistol with a high capacity magazine, and hundreds of rounds various types of ammunition. The Bushmaster AR 15 short-barreled rifle was also modified to fire automatically as a machinegun.\n\nCONTARTESI, is prohibited under federal law from possessing firearms and/or ammunition based upon his prior state felony conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. CONTARTESI also has prior state convictions including simple assault and battery and threatening the life of a public employee.\n\nMr. Nettles stated that CONTARTESI faces a statutory maximum sentence of ten (10) years, a fine of $250,000 and a term of supervised release of up to three (3) years following the term of imprisonment.\n\nThe case was investigated by ATF and was prosecuted as part of the joint federal, state and local Project CeaseFire initiative, which aggressively prosecutes firearm cases.

Dale Phillips said witness accounts and physical evidence have led investigators to believe that the two men were racing each other down the southbound lanes of the interstate at high speeds when contact was made between their two vehicles.\n\n\n\nPhillips said there is no evidence to suggest the contact was intentional, but it was enough to destabilize both vehicles and the men wrecked into each other then into the concrete median dividing the interstate before coming to a stop near Exit 100, just outside of Lake View, Ala.\n\n37-year-old Roderick Dale Washington, Jr. is charged with capital murder for the shooting death of a 40-year-old Tuscaloosa man.Investigators say the two were racing down I-20 at high speeds, collided and wrecked their vehicles before Washington shot the other driver. (Tuscaloosa County Jail)\n\nAfter the accident, the suspect exited his now-totaled Chevrolet Impala and walked over to his victim's wrecked Nissan Altima. Sgt. Phillips says evidence suggests he shot the other driver one time while his victim was still in his vehicle. The wounded man, 40-year-old\n\nFrederick Lee Blakely\n\n, got out of his car but collapsed on the ground and was found dead on the scene.\n\nWhen Lake View police officers and Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly after, they found 37-year-old\n\nRoderick Dale Washington, Jr.\n\n, the driver of the wrecked Impala. Washington suffered minor injuries in the crash and was taken to DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa for treatment.\n\nSince then, Phillips said evidence and witness reports gathered gave investigators reason to charge Washington with capital murder. He was taken in to custody and booked in the Tuscaloosa County Jail, where he will be held without bond.\n\nPhillips said there was no indication that the men knew each other before they began racing on the interstate Thursday night. He said it was unlikely that the two had a predetermined start and finish line for their race and the contest of speed was probably a spontaneous one initiated on the road.\n\nPhillips said the car accident was the sole result of the high rate of speed and carelessness of the drivers, and the state's recent winter weather woes did not come into play.\n\nWashington has three speeding tickets against him on record in the Alabama courts system, the most recent written in 2006. He has also had a pistol he was not licensed to carry seized by the Homewood Police Department in 2009, but his court records don't show a history of violence in the state.\n\nTraffic was stopped on I-20/59's southbound lanes for a few hours after the shooting as investigators combed through evidence on the scene and interviewed witnesses.

In the midst of a confrontation, the homeowner said he fired off several shots from a .357 revolver style handgun.\n\nEl Cajon police said the burglar was shot but escaped in another stolen truck he had driven to the crime scene on Chase Avenue.\n\nSuspect Joseph Mecurio then crashed into a home near Mona Place and died.\n\n\n\n\"Just because you break into someone's car, doesn't mean you can be killed,\" said Mecurio's mother, Monika Anderson.\n\n\n\nBut former District Attorney, now a Criminal Defense Attorney, Paul Pfingst said unbeknownst to the majority of the public, California law says you can actually be killed just for breaking into someone's car.\n\n\"In the state of California, you are allowed to defend your property. You've worked for your property,\" Pfingst said. \"A person's car could be critical to their livelihood and you don't have to let someone steal your property. You're allowed to stop them.\"\n\n\n\nPfingst said that includes using deadly force if the attempted burglary or other crime a person is trying to stop is a felony.\n\n\n\nWhether or not the break-in attempt was a felony could be a question El Cajon police are trying to answer in their investigation.

But, Mercurio brought a stolen vehicle to the scene, and it's unclear whether he intended to leave it there.\n\n\n\nIf Mercurio were trying to steal homeowner, Michael Po's truck, it would be a felony. But, if he were only trying to break into it, that could be a misdemeanor.\n\nPolice said a confrontation ensued between the two men when the homeowner, Po, tried to stop Mercurio from breaking into his truck.

The first victim lost his life in Tallapoosa County, while the second befell tragedy in Blount County. Both tragic accidents could have been avoided had greater safety precautions been taken. AL.com shared the stories.\n\nThe first fatal accident took place early in the morning, just after 6:30 a.m. near Tallapoosa's Lake Martin. The victim was a hunter named James Raymond Landers, a 50-year old man who was hunting a property - supposedly a public slab of land - with a bow.\n\nUnbeknownst to Landers, a second hunter was already scanning the property from atop a tree stand, with a gun in hand. The second hunter must have mistaken Landers for a deer or some other type of game animal, because when he saw movement in the woods, he took aim and fired.\n\nThe premature shot proved fatal, leaving Landers dead and igniting a police investigation in the area. So far, the shooting has been ruled an accident and blame has not been laid upon the other hunter. Precisely what the second hunter believed he was shooting at has not yet been clarified in the news.\n\nHowever, reports indicate that Landers wasn't wearing orange reflective gear and therefore could have reasonably been mistaken as a game animal. Still, the second hunter should not have fired until he knew what he was shooting at. Mistakes were made on both sides of the gun barrel, and both of them call for greater vigilance in hunting safety for all.\n\nThe police investigator in the Tallapoosa case stated that the investigation was ongoing, but that he couldn't recall more than maybe a single other hunting fatality occurring in his jurisdiction. However, while hunting fatalities may be rare, they sometimes coincide in bizarre fashion, and that's precisely what happened in the state of Alabama last weekend.\n\nAs Landers was being mourned in Tallapoosa County on Sunday evening, another hunter was felled in Blount County - roughly two and a half miles away by car. The Blount fatality struck Adam Scott Jordan, a 37-year old hunter who, unlike James Raymond Landers, had not been hunting alone on Sunday.\n\nRealted story: What Happens When An Alabama Deer Visits A Thrift Store? [VIDEO]\n\nOn the contrary, reports indicate that Jordan was hunting with two other friends when he was injured and killed. Reports say one of the other people he was hunting with accidentally discharged their weapon, and Jordan was on the receiving end of the blast. Much like with the Tallapoosa fatality, police reports stated that neither Jordan nor his hunting buddies had been wearing orange reflective clothing. Whether that piece of the story relates in any way to how Jordan was shot, however, is still a bit unclear.\n\nIn many places around the country, hunting accidents have actually been on the decline in recent years, but as these two twin Alabama shootings prove, there is still a great need for hunting safety classes and for other rules, regulations, and behaviors that can promote safe procedures among the hunting community. Wearing orange blaze is obviously a big safeguard that hunters can have to make sure they don't end up being mistaken for a game animal. However, trigger happy hunters also need to be more careful - and to be held more accountable - for stray shots that result in serious injuries and lost lives.", "publish_date": "2014-01-18"}, {"text": "On Saturday, March 10, 2018, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Deputies from the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to the MedStar St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Leonardtown for the report of a gunshot victim.\n\nDeputies arrived at the hospital and met with a black male in his thirties who was shot in the leg, the victim was uncooperative with police and provided little details of the shooting.\n\nThe hospital was on lockdown for a short period of time after the victim was brought to the emergency room by two women.\n\nNo further details are available at this time.", "publish_date": "2018-03-11"}, {"text": "JERSEY CITY -- The off-duty police officer who died of a gunshot wound Sunday night was a youth boxing coach, sources said.\n\nSources have identified the 33-year-old officer as Ramon Torres, who graduated from the academy last March.

That being said, it is extremely rare to allow individuals access to a building for any purpose if they participated in substantially disrupting the school.\"\n\nDeKeyser also provided this statement to MLive.com: \"This unfortunate incident tested many of our resources and we passed all of them, so far. The next test is how we grow to become better at preventing behaviors that result in threats of violence and, perhaps, the identification of warning signs which could preempt them.

It was announced at a press conference at the Ocean County administration building in Toms River.\n\nOcean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato, who called this the biggest drug bust in the county in 30 years, said the investigation spawned from a drug transaction in Lakewood and continued to move north.\n\nOne of the busts, he said, led to the seizure of 8 kilos of cocaine and a loaded AK-47. Prosecutors have been working feverishly to keep the suspect arrested in that raid, Rasheed Sanders of East Orange, behind bars after a judge initially ruled at his pre-trial detention hearing that he could be released with high-level monitoring. A new detention hearing for Sanders is scheduled for Monday at 9 a.m. after prosecutors filed additional charges against him.\n\nThe bust also led to the seizure of 20 firearms, including 18 handguns, and the dismantling of nine drug-producing facilities in Bloomfield, Jackson, Parlin, Paterson, Piscataway (4) and Plainfield. It also included the seizure of 27 vehicles, including a 2014 Jaguar XKR valued at $80,000.\n\nCoronato said the ring was a \"sophistic drug network,\" where the dealers were \"true business dealers\" who were able to broker deals to maximize profits.\n\n\"They would go in and negotiate with different drug dealers to get the better price and to get the quantity and when they could get the quantity,\" Coronato explained. \"So one time they would go to one drug dealer for their cocaine, if they didn't get a good enough price, they would go to the other drug dealer to get a better price on the cocaine.\"\n\nThe bust couldn't have happened, Coronato said, without the help of its federal partners through the Drug Enforcement Administration's Ocean/Monmouth High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.\n\nFirst Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Davenport said \"effects like this criminal organization are not just felt in Ocean County\" but \"through the state and beyond.\"\n\n\"By partnering together, as you see here today, we can increase our impact and make our streets safer and make our state safer,\" Davenport said.\n\nAll 1,901 people killed by opioids in N.J. last year, mapped Data obtained by NJ Advance Media shows the death toll from opioids in 2016 exceeds the population of more than 70 N.J. towns.\n\nCoronato said \"Ocean County, unfortunately, has been designated as Ground Zero for the opioid epidemic in New Jersey.\n\n\"When I first became prosecutor,\" he continued, \"it became really known to me that this is something we need to attack and that we certainly need to address.\"\n\nOcean County, which was one of the first counties in the state to begin equipping its first responders with Narcan as part of a pilot program administered under Gov. Chris Christie, has reduced its drug overdose deaths by 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, Coronato said.\n\nWhen asked why Ocean County is considered \"Ground Zero\" for the opioid epidemic, he said authorities continue to do studies to determine why.\n\n\"We're trying to track back why Ocean County is the epicenter,\" he explained. \"It is a bedroom community. With opiates, it all starts with pills. And the fact is, as a result of healthcare and access to pills, for whatever reason the residents of Ocean County have access to it.\n\n\"Bottom line is, when you can't get the pills anymore, it ends up going to heroin and other drugs. But I'm not so sure we can clearly determine why Ocean County.\"\n\nCoronato's term as prosecutor is up on March 22. He was nominated by Christie, a Republican, and it remains to be seen whether he will be reappointed with a new Democratic governor in office.\n\nAmong those arrested and charged with distributing drugs and weapons offenses were Jihad Anderson, 38, of Brick; Laquan Anderson,33, of Parlin; Lorenzo Balmer of Piscataway; Reynard Bronson, 34, of Newark; Sean Crosby, 35, of Lakewood; Gregory Delarosa, 38, of Jersey City; Bernard Mendez, of Lakewood; Robert Randolph, 36, Howell; Christopher Romero, 28, Lakewood; Byron Simpson, 46, of Plainfield.

This time, officers arrived to the 300 block of Ridge Street to find 19-year-old Dave Populus dead from a gunshot.\n\nIn a year that started relatively slow, the past three months have seen 13 murders in the Mobile police jurisdiction, contributing to a near mid-year total of 18. While the city is not quite on pace to break any annual homicide records, Police Chief James Barber said there are some obvious trends in 2014\u2019s cases.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\u201cThe big trend with homicide we\u2019ve seen lately is drug-related homicide,\u201d he said. \u201cMost homicides are between parties who are known to each other and often they are heat-of-the-moment, passion-type crimes \u2026 but we\u2019ve been challenged pretty heavily by the introduction of spice from an over-the-counter drug that went to street-level dealers.\u201d\n\nIn six of the 18 cases, including the two most recent, no arrests have been made, but Barber indicated some of those homicides may be related to more widespread criminal activity that is currently the subject of a larger investigation.\n\nHe singled out back-to-back murders on Next Street in May and several others in the vicinity of Webb Avenue as being particularly unusual.\n\n\u201cAll of them are in a nexus of spice-related criminal organizations, and that\u2019s an extensive operation because of the criminal organization involved,\u201d he said of the ongoing investigation. \u201cIt involves intelligence as well as the homicide unit.\u201d\n\nBarber spoke of taking an \u201coffender-oriented approach,\u201d to solving those murders, where the organizations are \u201cattacked\u201d by the department\u2019s intelligence to develop the information homicide needs in order to prosecute the suspects.\n\n\u201cThere are two main components of homicide and if you can figure out why it happened and how it happened, you can usually determine who did it,\u201d Barber said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have enough evidence to prosecute. You also have to rely on witness testimony, forensic evidence and statements from the defendant, if they are willing to provide them.\u201d\n\nExcept for three, all of Mobile\u2019s murder victims in 2014 have died from gunshot wounds. The exceptions were 19-year-old Tyrone Gable, who succumbed to blood loss after jumping through a glass window to escape a domestic altercation June 9, 23-month-old Christian Henderson, a toddler who appears to have been beaten and 23-year-old Quentavious Battiste, who was stabbed by his girlfriend.\n\nThe aggressor in the Gable case, 20-year-old Jimmie Lee Taite, was charged with felony murder even though he never directly attacked the victim.\n\n\u201cFrom a police standpoint, we see people with no criminal record at all commit homicide,\u201d Barber said, noting that Gable died while Taite was committing a breaking-and-entering and assault on another individual on the property.\n\nMobile reported a total of 27 homicides in 2013, which was down from a 10-year high of 42 in 2008. This year, five cases initially reported as homicide have been dismissed as justifiable, a number Barber said was \u201cextremely high.\u201d\n\n\u201cHomicide by definition merely means the killing of one human being by another and by itself is not a crime,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Justifiable\u2019 means that if you are trying to protect yourself from serious injury or death whereas unjustifiable are those with any malice or intent and those are called \u2018murder\u2019 under the criminal statute we use.\u201d\n\nBarber said any perceived \u201cuptick\u201d in the number of recent murders is the result of \u201cdisorganized, violent, inner-city crime,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t dismiss the cases as typical.\n\n\u201cI think there is every reason in the world to be alarmed,\u201d he said, repeating his talking point that spice could be as threatening to the community as crack cocaine was in the 1980s. Since then, \u201cwe have had a lot of success but now we have spice entering the scene and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing this large effort to stop it before it becomes an epidemic.\u201d\n\n2014 Homicides by date:\n\n\u2022 Jan. 6 \u2013 Charles David Busby, 32, was fatally shot in the 7500 block Bellingrath Road.

T'xer Zhon Kha/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nWAUSAU - A 35-year-old man apparently shot himself to death after police chased him into his home on Wausau's northeast side because they were concerned he was suicidal.\n\nOfficers didn't discover the man dead until about six hours later when they entered the home with a search warrant, Wausau Police Chief Ben Bliven said in an evening press conference at the city Public Safety Building.\n\nPolice had been searching for the man for 24 hours \u2014 based on a report that he threatened to harm himself \u2014 when officers spotted him driving away from the home in the 700 block of Augusta Avenue at 12:05 p.m. Wednesday, Bliven said. Officers tried to pull him over, but he drove back to his house and ran inside. Moments later, police heard a gunshot from inside the house.\n\n\"The ending of this incident is obviously not what we hoped for,\" Bliven said.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking for the family, and our thoughts and prayers are with them.\"\n\nPolice did not release the man's name but said they had been in contact with family members.\n\nThe house is north of East Wausau Avenue, along a street behind Lamb's Fresh Market grocery store.\n\nThe chief said police surrounded the home and blocked streets for hours before they went inside \u2014 even though they heard the gunshot immediately and there were no further sounds from the home \u2014 because they wanted to make sure the danger had passed.\n\nBliven said the man had previously threatened not only himself but \"also made statements that he would kill police officers.\"\n\nThey later determined that no one else was in danger during the incident and that no one else was injured, Bliven said.\n\nBecause the Marathon County SWAT team was initially away at a training exercise, SWAT units from Wood County and Marshfield assisted.\n\nAn armored vehicle with a battering ram affixed to the front approached the home from a back alley shortly before 5 p.m. Wednesday, while armed officers shielded themselves behind it and followed on foot.\n\nMeanwhile, other officers operated a remote-controlled robot that approached the house from the front. Police used an amplified speaker at one point to try to communicate with the man. Bliven said they never received a response.\n\nAbout 6:15 p.m., one of the officers told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that there was no threat to public safety and that the incident was expected to end soon. Moments later, law enforcement vehicles began to leave the area.\n\nThroughout the day, police were telling people to stay away from the area around Augusta Avenue between Seventh and Eighth streets. They blocked off Turner Street and Augusta Avenue and took cover behind their squad vehicles.\n\nOne bystander, Mitch Siewert, said he had dropped off his toddler daughter Wednesday morning at his mother-in-law's home across the street from the scene. He was anxious to get his child back, but the street blockade kept him away.\n\nSiewert said he had met a man who lives in the house and thought he was a nice person, but knew little else about him.\n\nRich Dyer, who lives nearby on Brown Street, said police activity in the neighborhood is common but something was different starting Tuesday night. Dyer said he saw multiple K-9 units in the area for a period of time, but they left later in the evening.\n\nA Wausau Police Department log entry said officers were called to the 700 block of Augusta Avenue at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to investigate \"threats of self-harm.\" No other details were provided in that report.\n\nRELATED: Bomb squad responds to downtown Wausau, evacuates\n\nWhile police and SWAT units were responding to Augusta Avenue, other local law enforcement officers were called to the 400 Block park in downtown Wausau for an unrelated bomb scare. Police shut down a block of Third Street, evacuated the city square and called in a bomb squad.\n\nBut within 45 minutes, they determined that a box found inside a planter, which had raised concern, was harmless.\n\nThe Marathon County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident on Augusta Avenue, Bliven said, because state law requires that police agencies not review their own officer-involved shooting deaths. Because Wausau police were trying to approach the man at the time of his death, this case fits that description, the chief said.\n\nBuy Photo Police block off Turner Street and Augusta Avenue as they take cover behind their squad vehicles.

BART officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies saluted as a gurney was rolled out of the hospital with an American flag draping the body, before it was put into a coroner\u2019s van and taken away, flanked by about 10 law enforcement officers on motorcycles.\n\nThe shooting rattled residents of the sprawling apartment complex in the East Bay suburb. Rosalia Vazquez, who lives several doors down from where the shooting occurred inside the Park Sierra Apartments, said she wasn\u2019t home at the time.

The last time a police officer in Alameda County was killed by another officer was in January 2001, when two Oakland police officers shot and killed an undercover detective.\n\nOfficer William Wilkins was pursing an auto thief near 89th Avenue when Officers Andrew Koponen and Timothy Scarrott arrived as Wilkins drew his weapon on the suspect. Both officers fired several times, killing Wilkins, after they said he ignored orders to drop the weapon.\n\nThe shooting was the latest challenge for the BART system and its police force. Jan. 1 marked five years since BART police officer Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, who was being detained on a platform at the Fruitvale station.\n\nMore recently, the system was shut down by failed contract negotiations that led to strikes that stranded hundreds of thousands of Bay Area commuters in July and October. Two workers were killed during the October strike, when they were struck by a train on its way to a maintenance yard as they performed track inspections in Walnut Creek.\n\nStaff writers Denis Cuff, Lisa Vorderbreuggen, Thomas Peele and Matt O\u2019Brien contributed to this report.", "publish_date": "2014-01-21"}, {"text": "JACKSON, MI - Hearings in the case of a man charged with murder for killing his 31-year-old son have been delayed and a jury trial is expected to be rescheduled.\n\nThere are concerns about Eldon Huffman's health and how a long trial might affect it, Huffman's lawyer, Eric White, said Monday, May 11.\n\nA hearing, once set for last week, was scheduled for Monday and a trial was to begin June 1.

Supervisors may be rotated at the director's discretion, he said.\n\nJarzynka's letter, copied to Boulter, contained no explicit requests or threats and he said any personnel decisions are made at Jester's sole authority.\n\nHuffman was arrested in January 2014. A state police detective subsequently testified he was skeptical of parts of Eldon Huffman's self-defense account.\n\nHuffman, who was not seriously hurt, had told the detective his son hit him with various weapons and Eldon Huffman took a handgun out of his pocket and told his son to stop. When Jared Huffman started swinging again, Eldon Huffman said he shot him in the leg, according to earlier testimony.\n\nAn unarmed Jared Huffman started to hobble toward a back bedroom and laundry area, where police later found guns, and Huffman shot him again, hitting him in the back of the head.\n\nA first trial began in September, but Wilson declared a mistrial because state police had information that had not been provided to White or the prosecution.", "publish_date": "2015-05-11"}, {"text": "DAYTONA BEACH \u2014 Police are trying to find a masked man who waved a handgun in a Citgo convenience store and robbed a cashier of her cellphone, police said.\n\nAccording to an incident report, Vaibhav Kakade was working alone at the Citgo, 580 Mason Ave., just before 9 p.m. Thursday when a man whose face was covered with a ski mask pointed a gun at the clerk\u2019s face.\n\nThe suspect began yelling, \u201cGive it to me, give it to me,\u201d and the 26-year-old Kakade thought the robber wanted money, the report shows.

Plenty, say Second Amendment advocates.\n\nUkraine, a nation of 45 million people, has restrictive laws governing private gun ownership. The government is in possession of more than seven million guns, while three million weapons, both legal and illicit, are in the hands of private citizens, creating a staggering gulf in firepower. By comparison, in the United States, there are 310 million guns in private hands, with only 3.85 million possessed by the military and police forces.\n\nThis fuels a longstanding argument held by gun rights advocates, that the government should not have a monopoly on the country\u2019s firearms. As largely unarmed Ukrainian protestors face off against a military armed with the world\u2019s sixth-largest inventory of small arms, American supporters of the right to bear arms are decrying restrictive gun laws both here and in Ukraine\u2014and in Venezuela, where citizens are demanding better security and protected freedom of speech.

But the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under the new legislation \u2014 which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward\u2019s Chief Judge Jack Tuter.\n\nThe man is also prohibited from trying to purchase or obtain guns or ammunition from any source.\n\nThe legislation is part of a bill signed one week ago by Gov. Rick Scott. The new laws impose some restrictions on gun sales and give law enforcement new power to take action when they have evidence that a person may pose a danger. The National Rifle Association immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court in Tallahassee challenging some aspects of the law, including the legality of banning gun sales to people under the age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe put the safety of our residents first,\u201d said Lighthouse Point Mayor Glenn Troast. \u201cThis is not about the Second Amendment and it\u2019s not about the NRA.

Troast said he grew up in a law enforcement family, hunted with guns and has a healthy respect for firearms and gun rights.\n\nLighthouse Point police made the request on March 14, one week after they were called to conduct a welfare check on the man, who they said was behaving strangely at his condominium building. Authorities said it was the latest in a series of encounters law enforcement had with the man, though he has no prior history of arrests in Florida. He had some prior arrests in Pennsylvania, records show.\n\nPolice were called after the man turned off the main electrical breakers to the condo building in Lighthouse Point, court records show. The South Florida Sun Sentinel is not identifying the man because of his medical condition.\n\nThe man told officers he \u201cwas being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in [his] building,\u201d the judge wrote in his order. \u201c[He] could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor [can] \u2018shape shift, he can change heights and I\u2019m not sure where he comes from\u2019 and \u2018to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also told officers that he had to turn off the electrical breakers because \u201cthey are electrocuting me through my legs.\u201d\n\nOfficers said they saw weapons in his home after they were called to check on his welfare.

A very short time after the man was released from hospital, he demanded the return of his firearms. Police were still concerned for his well-being and the safety of others.

Many of my officers that went on the scene are having a hard time with it. The things that go through their minds, asking the question that can't be answered, which is 'Why?'\n\nSPANISH FORK \u2014 A shocking discovery was made late Thursday at a home where police believe a police officer shot and killed his wife, two young children and his mother-in-law, before killing himself.\n\nIt was the second murder-suicide in Utah involving parents killing their children in just two days.\n\nThe bodies of Kelly Boren, 32, Joshua \u201cJaden\u201d Boren, 7, Haley Boren, 5, and Marie King, 55, and officer Joshua Boren, 34, were found Thursday night inside a Spanish Fork house at 37 N. 630 West where they all lived.\n\n\"We're a small department. Our families are one big family, so we knew his entire family as well. Just a tremendous shock to our entire organization,\" said Lindon Police Chief Cody Cullimore.\n\nJosh Boren was a Lindon police officer and had previously worked at the Utah County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"He was well-liked, had a lot of friends at the sheriff's office,\" said Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon. \"He was a big guy, just solid as a rock muscle guy. But just a teddy bear is how I would have described him. Just a mild-mannered personality.\"\n\nBut Cannon said that image of the hulking teddy bear is now gone as officers try to deal with the shock of hearing about Boren's apparent horrific actions.\n\n\"How we knew him suddenly fades into the distance because of the heinous nature of what he has apparently done. How do you talk about Josh as a good person, and all the good things that he did and all the good work he did and the good deputy that he was, when he appears to have done something that is almost unexplainable. I mean, how do you wrap your mind around killing your wife, your two children, and your mother-in-law? You just can't,\" Cannon said.\n\n\"Suddenly, it just seems inappropriate to talk about him as a good deputy. It would be inappropriate to talk about the good things that he does when there is a family out there now suffering at the tragic and senseless loss of a mother and daughter and cousins and grandchildren. That's where the focus needs to be because that's where the real tragedy lies. There are four innocent victims who have died for no reason at all.\"\n\nNeighbors of the family shared in the disbelief expressed by law enforcement.\n\n\"The kids came over and played with our kids all the time, and I would always see them at the gym and would always wave to Kelly and Josh,\" said neighbor Brian Sloan. \"You feel sad for the kids and it is kind of weird, you see see this on TV and now it happens to a neighbor.\"\n\n\"We decided saying a prayer for the rest of the family was best,\" added neighbor Nadine Meyer. \"This is a very close-knit neighborhood, and we take care of each other. But when they are all gone, there is no one to take care of, which is difficult to deal with.\"\n\nBoth Cullimore and Cannon said they were aware of marital problems between Josh and Kelly Boren.\n\n\"I was aware there had been a brief set period of separation. I was not aware of any violence in the past or anything like that. Again, his wife, Kelly, was a friend of mine, a friend of my wife. So anything major that would have happened, I would have known about,\" Cullimore said.\n\nKelly Boren had worked in the Human Resources Department for the city of Bluffdale since August. Prior to that, she was the finance director for the town of Vineyard for six years.\n\nSpanish Fork police, who are investigating the killings, said Friday they believe that martial contention led to Boren shooting his family.\n\nThe first sign of trouble came Thursday night when Boren was scheduled to be at work at 10 p.m. When he hadn't arrived by 11 p.m., officers were sent to his house to do a welfare check.\n\n\"They were just concerned he hadn't arrived for work,\" Spanish Fork Police Chief Steven Adams said. \"If an officer is supposed to be on duty at 10 o'clock, he should be there at 10 o'clock. It might not be that in other businesses or employment. But if an officer doesn't arrive on duty at the time he's assigned, there's something amiss.\"\n\nWhen officers arrived at the home, they looked through the windows. The lights were on and the front door was unlocked.\n\nThrough the window, the officers could see blood on the carpet, shell casings, a handgun and even a slug, Adams said. After officers entered the home, they discovered \"a large quantity of blood on the stairway leading to the second floor of the residence.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law was found deceased in one upstairs bedroom, and the four others in another.\n\nThe last known phone contact with the Boren family was about 4:30 p.m. Thursday. That phone call was not of a distressed nature, Adams said. Police have never been called to the Boren house for a domestic call or complaint of any kind, he said. The family apparently had lived there for four or five years.\n\nPolice said neighbors did not report hearing any gunshots.\n\n\"This is a tragedy in anybody's life, whether you're in law enforcement as Joshua is, or not. Many of my officers that went on the scene are having a hard time with it. The things that go through their minds, asking the question that can't be answered, which is 'Why?'\" Adams said.\n\nAdams declined to say what evidence led detectives to believe Josh Boren killed his family before shooting himself. \"There are specific things we believe have happened in the home, those specific things I'm not going to get into today\" he said.\n\nPolice noted, however, that no suicide note was found.\n\nAdams said investigators would likely be going through the house for a couple of days collecting evidence. However, the biggest question may never be answered.\n\n\"We hope to gain an understanding at some time of all the things that were going through Josh's mind, but I'm certain we'll not be able to do that,\" the chief said.\n\nThe children, Josh and Haley, attended the American Leadership Academy charter school in Spanish Fork. The Nebo School District sent crisis counselors over to the school to assist students at the school Friday. The district also sent counselors to Spanish Fork Elementary School, even though the children never attended that school, to help other young students who may have heard the news.\n\nOn Kelly Boren's Facebook page, she posted an old picture of her children on Thursday. There are several pictures of her and her children enjoying a trip to Southern California and Disneyland at the end of December.\n\nDespite their known marital problems, Cannon said there was never a hint of potential violence on the part of Josh Boren.\n\n\"There was no indication to anybody this was going to happen. A number of people knew he was having struggles in his marriage, but that's not uncommon. People in all professions, in all areas of life, some have struggles with their marriages,\" he said. \"There was nothing going on that rose to the level of concern that anything bad in any way might happen.\"\n\nJosh Boren was hired by the Utah County Jail as a corrections officer in 2006. He worked several jobs, including as an animal control officer at one point. He left the jail to become a patrol officer for the 15-member Lindon Police Department in October. But he also continued to work at the jail part time. He was selected from a field of 70 qualified applicants to fill the Lindon position.\n\nUtah County offers an employee assistance program for anyone who is having problems at home or feeling stress, Cannon said. Employees can talk to counselors and their conversations will be kept confidential from their employer, unless the employee confesses illegal activity, he said.\n\nThe tragedy in Spanish Fork is the second incident in less than a week of a parent killing other members of their family before taking their own life.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kyler Ramsdell-Oliva, 32, shot her two daughters, Kenadee Oliva, 13, and Isabella Oliva, 7, in their Syracuse home before killing herself.\n\nThe mother had just broken up with her fiance and told him to leave their home. Close friend Pegi Butler said Ramsdell-Oliva had fought depression, but things in her life had improved in recent years. She confessed to Butler that she still loved the man deeply but was heartbroken. Still, Butler never suspected she or the girls were in any danger when they spoke on Sunday.\n\nIn 2013, the Deseret News counted seven incidents of domestic-related murder-suicides where anger, jealousy or depression appeared to be motivating factors. In 2012 there were four, according to statistics kept by the Deseret News.\n\n\"What's really important, I think, for folks to understand is that these really tragic incidents rarely happen in isolation. Often times there may be some other things that are happening. People may be feeling extremely desperate, depressed, they may have made threats to hurt themselves or other people in their family,\" said Kendra Wyckoff, interim director of the Utah Domestic Violence Council.\n\nWyckoff said it was important for those threats to be taken seriously.\n\nAs to why some people kill their children in addition to their significant other before killing themselves, she said she didn't have a good answer.\n\n\"Clearly, people are in a desperate place. We need to help people understand there are resources available. There is help.\"\n\nThere are two suicide hotlines in the state for people to get help.\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Hotline, 1-800-273-8255, operates 24 hours a day.

During the pursuit, he rammed a police cruiser in Augusta.

An 18-year-old boy is dead and three other teens were shot all because this defendant decided to commit senseless and terrible acts of violence. Now he will pay for what he did by being locked up for most of his life.\u201d\n\nThe District Attorney identified the defendant as Brandon Reese, 21, of Brooklyn. He was today sentenced by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Sheryl Parker to 47 years to life in prison following his conviction earlier this month on one count of second-degree murder, one count of second-degree attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, one count of first-degree attempted assault, one count of second-degree assault, one count of second-degree attempted assault, one count of first-degree reckless endangerment, and two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon following a jury trial.\n\nThe District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, on July 6, 2013, at approximately 6:30 p.m., at the Marcy Houses, located at 472 Marcy Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, during a basketball tournament two rival crews engaged in a dispute which ultimately resulted in a shooting.\n\nThe District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, a number of gang members from Bushwick Houses, who belong to a crew named Young Stackers (YS), were hanging out in front of Marcy Houses. A member of Stack Money Goonz (SMG) walked by and realized that one of the YS\u2019s had previously pulled a gun on him. He then called his older brother, the defendant, Brandon Reese, for back-up.\n\nThe District Attorney further said that, according to trial testimony, after an argument ensued between his brother and the YS kids, the defendant pulled his gun from his waistband and fired approximately nine shots. Mario Lopez was shot approximately eight times and pronounced dead later that evening. Three others were injured: A 13-year-old shot in the neck with the bullet exiting his nose was left with permanent partial paralysis of his face; a second 13-year-old was shot in the knee; a 15-year-old was grazed on the hip and suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe case was investigated by now retired New York City Police Detective James Tischler and other detectives assigned to the NYPD\u2019s 79th precinct.\n\nThe case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Chavis, Chief of the District Attorney\u2019s Violent Criminal Enterprises Bureau, with the assistance of Assistant District Attorney Iris Das, under the supervision of Executive Assistant District Attorney William E.

A Jefferson Parish grand jury handed up an indictment last week charging him in Anderson's death.\n\nThe trial date was announced Friday, during a status hearing in 24th Judicial District Judge Robert Pitre's court. Bethune, one of numerous inmates who appeared in court, said nothing during the brief hearing. He's due back in court next month.\n\nAnderson, 31, an animal-care specialist who had served two tours in Iraq and one in Kuwait, was dropping off his three children, ages 7, 11 and 12, at their grandparents' home in the 6100 block of Ray Street, when he was shot in the face in the driveway. He died just hours before he was scheduled to return to his duty station at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.\n\nHis mother's vehicle, which he was driving, was stolen, leading authorities initially to suspect the soldier was killed during a carjacking. Deputies found it the following day, about two miles away on Rue Louis St. Phillipe in Marrero.\n\nHowever, court records show a link between the suspect and the soldier. Bethune had been romantically involved with Anderson's former wife, according to a court stay-away order in which he is identified as her \"current or former dating partner.\" Authorities have not discussed publicly the link in connection with the homicide.\n\nBethune is charged with unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, accused of going into Anderson's ex-wife's home in Harvey without permission on Jan. 5, days after Anderson was killed, court records show. In connection with his bond in that criminal case, he was barred from being within 300 feet of her, court records show.\n\nAnderson and his wife, who had accused him of abusing her and moved back to Jefferson Parish from Hawaii as a result in 2012, were divorced in September, court records show. The former couple was granted joint custody of their children in November. The children live with her, but Anderson was to get custody alternatively on major holidays, including New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, according to the custody agreement.\n\nAbout a month after Anderson was killed, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office detectives announced Bethune as their suspect. Bethune turned himself in days later.\n\nBethune would face mandatory life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. He remains jailed in lieu of a $2 million bond. Prosecutors sought the unusually high bond because they say Bethune applied for a passport so he could leave the country.\n\nHis attorneys will seek a court order in an attempt to bar prosecutors from presenting some evidence during the trial. The \"suppression hearing\" is set for Sept. 19.\n\nFriday's status hearing was housekeeping in nature.

That's 15 of our 40 entries in this installment. And continuing the pattern, several did so while happily and unconcernedly carrying their hand-held instant death machines among you, while out shopping, dining or otherwise enjoying the amenities. Were you in Chipotle in Sandy, Utah, last week? Walmart in Hattiesburg, Mississippi? Sam's Club in Waterloo, Iowa? Perhaps the YMCA in Austin, Texas? Maybe you weren't, but people who were certain they knew how to properly handle their firearms were. And guess where they found out that they weren't really up to the task? Right in the middle of the crowds, of course! Miraculously, only one car window and one ass (anatomically speaking) were damaged. You can thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that none of the children at their swimming lessons at the Y were shot when mom blew a hole in her purse rummaging around down in Austin.\n\nA few \"coincidences\" worthy of note this time around: two people accidentally discharged their weapons while giving demonstrations of how safe they were, one lodging a bullet in his living room floor, and one lodging a bullet in a place that stopped him from living and left him on the floor. Last week also saw two young men accidentally shoot their mothers, one in Oconee Co., South Carolina, and one in Dayton, Nevada. And although this one doesn't exactly fit, an Orlando, Florida, man accidentally fired his gun twice while he was cleaning it (of course). His first shot flew through his garage door and into the street, where it blasted a hole in a passing car, and microseconds thereafter, the 12-year-old girl inside it. So flustered by this accident was he that he fired a second shot through his own thigh.\n\nThere were three \"home invasion\" shootings, in which civic-minded patriots opt to share their used ammunition with neighbors. The most worthy of note being the Marion, Ohio, accident in which a good guy with a shotgun decided to participate in the prayer meeting in the downstairs apartment. His testimony was witnessed by two of the ladies of the assembly.\n\nOutside of those noteworthy items, we saw the usual assortment of accidents. One hunting accident, one accident while \"fixing\" a gun, one target shooting mishap, one stray bullet shooting, and one cop's gun that went off when it was grabbed by a suspect.

It was announced at a press conference at the Ocean County administration building in Toms River.\n\nOcean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato, who called this the biggest drug bust in the county in 30 years, said the investigation spawned from a drug transaction in Lakewood and continued to move north.\n\nOne of the busts, he said, led to the seizure of 8 kilos of cocaine and a loaded AK-47. Prosecutors have been working feverishly to keep the suspect arrested in that raid, Rasheed Sanders of East Orange, behind bars after a judge initially ruled at his pre-trial detention hearing that he could be released with high-level monitoring. A new detention hearing for Sanders is scheduled for Monday at 9 a.m. after prosecutors filed additional charges against him.\n\nThe bust also led to the seizure of 20 firearms, including 18 handguns, and the dismantling of nine drug-producing facilities in Bloomfield, Jackson, Parlin, Paterson, Piscataway (4) and Plainfield. It also included the seizure of 27 vehicles, including a 2014 Jaguar XKR valued at $80,000.\n\nCoronato said the ring was a \"sophistic drug network,\" where the dealers were \"true business dealers\" who were able to broker deals to maximize profits.\n\n\"They would go in and negotiate with different drug dealers to get the better price and to get the quantity and when they could get the quantity,\" Coronato explained. \"So one time they would go to one drug dealer for their cocaine, if they didn't get a good enough price, they would go to the other drug dealer to get a better price on the cocaine.\"\n\nThe bust couldn't have happened, Coronato said, without the help of its federal partners through the Drug Enforcement Administration's Ocean/Monmouth High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.\n\nFirst Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Davenport said \"effects like this criminal organization are not just felt in Ocean County\" but \"through the state and beyond.\"\n\n\"By partnering together, as you see here today, we can increase our impact and make our streets safer and make our state safer,\" Davenport said.\n\nAll 1,901 people killed by opioids in N.J. last year, mapped Data obtained by NJ Advance Media shows the death toll from opioids in 2016 exceeds the population of more than 70 N.J. towns.\n\nCoronato said \"Ocean County, unfortunately, has been designated as Ground Zero for the opioid epidemic in New Jersey.\n\n\"When I first became prosecutor,\" he continued, \"it became really known to me that this is something we need to attack and that we certainly need to address.\"\n\nOcean County, which was one of the first counties in the state to begin equipping its first responders with Narcan as part of a pilot program administered under Gov. Chris Christie, has reduced its drug overdose deaths by 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, Coronato said.\n\nWhen asked why Ocean County is considered \"Ground Zero\" for the opioid epidemic, he said authorities continue to do studies to determine why.\n\n\"We're trying to track back why Ocean County is the epicenter,\" he explained. \"It is a bedroom community. With opiates, it all starts with pills. And the fact is, as a result of healthcare and access to pills, for whatever reason the residents of Ocean County have access to it.\n\n\"Bottom line is, when you can't get the pills anymore, it ends up going to heroin and other drugs. But I'm not so sure we can clearly determine why Ocean County.\"\n\nCoronato's term as prosecutor is up on March 22. He was nominated by Christie, a Republican, and it remains to be seen whether he will be reappointed with a new Democratic governor in office.\n\nAmong those arrested and charged with distributing drugs and weapons offenses were Jihad Anderson, 38, of Brick; Laquan Anderson,33, of Parlin; Lorenzo Balmer of Piscataway; Reynard Bronson, 34, of Newark; Sean Crosby, 35, of Lakewood; Gregory Delarosa, 38, of Jersey City; Bernard Mendez, of Lakewood; Robert Randolph, 36, Howell; Christopher Romero, 28, Lakewood; Byron Simpson, 46, of Plainfield.

It was simply strung across his back.\u201d\n\nKeoughan was actually out that afternoon searching for a suitable route for a weekend rally hosted by the group, whose primary goal is to educate and inform the public about the legalities of open carry.\n\nPart of the reason Keoughan\u2019s arrest came as such a shock to the group was that they believed they had \u201cassurances\u201d from Police Chief Bud Jones that something like this would not occur again. However, Jones believed that their \u201cassurances\u201d were more of a miscommunication.\n\n\u201cIf an individual on his own wants to do that, he, out of the common courtesy, should contact us. That\u2019s what I told them,\u201d Jones said, adding, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who he was, had no clue, but we started getting a mass number of phone calls, by displaying the weapon, he caused undue alarm.\u201d\n\nJones, who said the gun rights group has his full support, stated that his main concern is for the protection of the people in the community.\n\n\u201cThis is the issue that they don\u2019t want to address that we have to address,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen we get a call about a person with a gun, do we ignore it? Walking down the street? They\u2019re alluding to the fact that we don\u2019t have any right to make contact to them because they\u2019re not doing anything wrong. I beg to differ with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell anybody, they say they don\u2019t have to, and yeah they probably don\u2019t, but when they disrupt the community like they did, something has to happen,\u201d Jones later told a local CBS affiliate.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a hostile environment, but again you have an armed individual and I\u2019m not going to go into detail on what we consider a hostile environment,\u201d Jones added.\n\nHowever, Keoughan doesn\u2019t argue with law enforcement\u2019s right to investigate the situation, what he doesn\u2019t agree with is the fact that he was still arrested and charged with what he feels are false accusations.\n\n\u201cJust because someone calls in and says they\u2019re alarmed doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an actual threat in the carrying,\u201d McDonald agreed. \u201cIt can be alarming to some, I understand that but that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re here. To educate the public and get the word out that we\u2019re not the enemy. We\u2019re fighting for your rights.\u201d\n\nKeoughan was the second member of \u201cCome and Take It\u201d to be arrested in Andrews after openly carrying a long arm, in addition to several others recently arrested across Texas for the same offense.\n\nThree men were arrested in September for disorderly conduct after they sat outside a San Antonio Starbucks sipping on iced coffees and \u201cenjoying their Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nThe arrest of Army Master Sgt.

(Published Tuesday, March 13, 2018)\n\nThe mother of a suspected vehicle burglar said she's outraged police are not pursuing charges against the El Cajon homeowner who fatally shot her son.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, an El Cajon resident said he shot someone he believed was breaking into his truck. In the midst of a confrontation, the homeowner said he fired off several shots from a .357 revolver style handgun.\n\nEl Cajon police said the burglar was shot but escaped in another stolen truck he had driven to the crime scene on Chase Avenue.\n\nSuspect Joseph Mecurio then crashed into a home near Mona Place and died.\n\n\n\n\"Just because you break into someone's car, doesn't mean you can be killed,\" said Mecurio's mother, Monika Anderson.\n\n\n\nBut former District Attorney, now a Criminal Defense Attorney, Paul Pfingst said unbeknownst to the majority of the public, California law says you can actually be killed just for breaking into someone's car.\n\n\"In the state of California, you are allowed to defend your property. You've worked for your property,\" Pfingst said. \"A person's car could be critical to their livelihood and you don't have to let someone steal your property. You're allowed to stop them.\"\n\n\n\nPfingst said that includes using deadly force if the attempted burglary or other crime a person is trying to stop is a felony.\n\n\n\nWhether or not the break-in attempt was a felony could be a question El Cajon police are trying to answer in their investigation. Lt. Walt Miller said there is no indication a second suspect was involved in the incident. But, Mercurio brought a stolen vehicle to the scene, and it's unclear whether he intended to leave it there.\n\n\n\nIf Mercurio were trying to steal homeowner, Michael Po's truck, it would be a felony. But, if he were only trying to break into it, that could be a misdemeanor.\n\nPolice said a confrontation ensued between the two men when the homeowner, Po, tried to stop Mercurio from breaking into his truck. If Mercurio threatened Po with any violence, that brings his actions back up to a felony, no matter what his intentions were with Po's truck.\n\n\"He's never been violent in his entire life,\" his mother Monika Anderson said. Anderson said her son is a heroin addict and was probably looking for drugs or money in the truck to steal.\n\nAnderson would not say how or why she suspects that. She said Mercurio has been trying to get sober since his twin brother overdosed in 2011 and has been in and out of eight rehab centers.\n\n\"He wanted to get sober so bad,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAnderson said Mercurio was the best son anyone could hope for and leaves behind a 6-year-old daughter.\n\n\n\nPfingst said the bottom line is the law protects property owners and places the risk for criminal activity on the criminals.\n\n\"If someone wants to steal your property and it's felony property, you don't have to run away,\" Pfingst said. \"And you don't have to let them walk away with your property. You're allowed to fight and defend your property and you're allowed to use deadly force to do it under the law.\"\n\nEl Cajon police have said it is unlikely charges will be filed against Po.\n\nNBC 7 investigated Mercurio's criminal history, finding no convictions for violent crimes, as his mother said.\n\nMercurio was charged with a handful of felony and misdemeanor drug and paraphernalia possession charges, along with DUI charges between 2005 and 2014.\n\nThe District Attorney's office has not yet received the case.

But the civil ruling removing his access to guns and ammunition was granted under the new legislation \u2014 which permits confiscating guns from people who have not been committed but are deemed a potential risk to themselves or others, according to the order signed by Broward\u2019s Chief Judge Jack Tuter.\n\nThe man is also prohibited from trying to purchase or obtain guns or ammunition from any source.\n\nThe legislation is part of a bill signed one week ago by Gov. Rick Scott. The new laws impose some restrictions on gun sales and give law enforcement new power to take action when they have evidence that a person may pose a danger. The National Rifle Association immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court in Tallahassee challenging some aspects of the law, including the legality of banning gun sales to people under the age of 21.\n\n\u201cWe put the safety of our residents first,\u201d said Lighthouse Point Mayor Glenn Troast. \u201cThis is not about the Second Amendment and it\u2019s not about the NRA.

Troast said he grew up in a law enforcement family, hunted with guns and has a healthy respect for firearms and gun rights.\n\nLighthouse Point police made the request on March 14, one week after they were called to conduct a welfare check on the man, who they said was behaving strangely at his condominium building. Authorities said it was the latest in a series of encounters law enforcement had with the man, though he has no prior history of arrests in Florida. He had some prior arrests in Pennsylvania, records show.\n\nPolice were called after the man turned off the main electrical breakers to the condo building in Lighthouse Point, court records show. The South Florida Sun Sentinel is not identifying the man because of his medical condition.\n\nThe man told officers he \u201cwas being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in [his] building,\u201d the judge wrote in his order. \u201c[He] could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor [can] \u2018shape shift, he can change heights and I\u2019m not sure where he comes from\u2019 and \u2018to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also told officers that he had to turn off the electrical breakers because \u201cthey are electrocuting me through my legs.\u201d\n\nOfficers said they saw weapons in his home after they were called to check on his welfare. They also found evidence he had \u201ca voluminous amount of notes containing numerous references to former President Barack Obama, that he was killed in the 1980s but came back and now murders children to place their spirits into [the man\u2019s] head, is a member of [al-Qaida], and is [the man\u2019s] enemy,\u201d the judge wrote in his order.\n\nThe man was involuntarily committed for treatment in a separate proceeding and it is not yet known when he would be eligible for release, records show. The man did not attend the initial hearing, which temporarily removes his access to guns, because he is hospitalized.\n\nThe guns that were temporarily seized were a Ruger LCP .380 pistol, an M2 Mauser .45 pistol, a Charter Arms .357 mag snub nose revolver and a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun, according to the court order. Authorities have also begun the process of notifying federal and state authorities, as required by the law, so that the issue would be flagged if the man attempts to purchase a gun.\n\nLighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata said officers have had interactions with the man over a number of years but none of them had risen to the level that would have warranted removing the man\u2019s access to guns. There was also no legal method to do so in the past.\n\n\u201cI think this is what the general public has been looking for \u2014 for law enforcement to be able to intervene in these kinds of situations \u2014 for a long time,\u201d the chief said.\n\nHe said he wished he had such legislation a couple of years ago when another city resident was involuntarily committed for psychiatric help after a domestic incident and police took his guns for safekeeping. A very short time after the man was released from hospital, he demanded the return of his firearms. Police were still concerned for his well-being and the safety of others. Officers eventually agreed to release the guns to a family member, Licata said.\n\nLicata said he anticipates other communities around the state will soon file their own requests as issues arise in their own communities.\n\n\u201cThis may be the first but it\u2019s certainly not going to be the last,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the requirements of the state law, Lighthouse Point police, Cirullo and the man whose guns were removed are due in court on March 28 for a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year.", "publish_date": "2018-03-16"}, {"text": "Around 3:15 p.m., somebody fired three shots.

His girlfriend was struck in the head, and he brought her by private transport to a local hospital for treatment.\n\nDiaz\u2019s girlfriend, now 25, suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the shooting and now resides in a nursing home; her injuries left her unable to communicate with anyone.\n\nIn trying to explain the incident to police, law enforcement agents said, Diaz claimed that he was a drug dealer and that his girlfriend had been shot as three purported masked robbers invaded their home and looked for marijuana. However, he would later admit to the shooting and claimed that he threw the gun into a sewer.\n\nA search of the sewer where Diaz said he threw the weapon ended with negative results. Police, however, did recover more than 50 pounds of marijuana inside his apartment.\n\nDiaz was initially tried in March of this year, but it ended in a mistrial when a juror became unable to continue while deliberations were underway.

Wagner announced. Eloy Gonzalez-Rocha was also charged with being a deported alien found in the United States.\n\nAccording to court documents, on January 8, 2014, Fresno County Sheriff deputies investigated complaints about a strong smell of marijuana and various activities at a property in Dunlap in Fresno County. They found the brothers, who are undocumented, in a rented mobile home on the property. After obtaining a search warrant, narcotics detectives found 260 marijuana plants, more than 200 pounds of processed marijuana, $15,160 in cash, and three firearms, one of which was reported stolen from Arkansas and another having an obliterated serial number. Eloy Gonzalez-Ramirez had been deported from the United States nearly one year before he was found in Dunlap.

In the suit, Taylor alleged that Ambrifi was not properly trained and had used excessive force against him during the altercation.\n\nTaylor, who has been in jail since June 2013, had lost an appeal in July to have the indictment dismissed because the grand jury did not consider his mental issues. A psychological evaluation determined that Taylor is schizophrenic and family and friends said he became obsessed with religion and even death in the days before the incident, according to court documents.\n\nA trial date had been set for January, but Taylor opted instead for the bench trial.

Sanchez / Chicago Tribune)\n\nThe young woman arrived home to find a footprint still visible on her front door. Her South Shore apartment had been broken into, and the small safe she kept under her bed was missing, along with the black .40-caliber Glock handgun she kept inside. Over the next year, that Glock would fire 42 bullets, leaving shell casings scattered on walkways, porches and side streets. In the hands of a street gang, the gun was used in at least five separate shootings that left two dead and five others wounded, police say. Officers found the weapon \u2014 loaded with 21 rounds and hidden in a Nike shoebox \u2014 during a routine check in 2015 at a parolee's South Side home, just blocks from where it had been stolen. An extended magazine had been added for firepower and a laser sight for accuracy. Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune A Glock used in five shootings that killed two people sits at the Homan Square police facility June 9, 2016, in Chicago. A Glock used in five shootings that killed two people sits at the Homan Square police facility June 9, 2016, in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) The story of the Glock's journey from safe to shoebox comes at a tumultuous time for Chicago as homicides spike to levels unseen in the city for two decades. Chicago police say the proliferation of guns plays a key role in the seemingly endless cycle of violence, particularly in impoverished pockets of the South and West sides. As police battle the glut of firearms, the Glock illustrates the devastation \u2014 both human and financial \u2014 that a single gun can leave behind. The Tribune spent several months retracing the gun's movements, visiting each shooting scene, talking to residents who two years later still remember the gunfire that interrupted their lives, speaking to the only victim willing to talk. The Glock was what police call a gang gun, passed among its members as needed. Its devastation \u2014 unusual for one firearm in a year's time \u2014 was spread over a significant stretch of the South Side. \"I've seen five young men lose their lives on this block,\" longtime resident Randolph Strahan said from his front yard in the 2700 block of East 76th Street, just steps from a neighbor's porch where a father of two was killed in the first shooting linked to the Glock by ballistics evidence. \"What's it like to live here?\" the retiree asked rhetorically when a reporter inquired about the block. His soft voice was nearly drowned out by the whistle of a Metra train passing nearby. \"Where are you from?\" he asked. \"You don't know what it's like to be numb.\" Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune Chicagoan Randolph Strahan lives on East 76th Street, where a father of two was killed in the first shooting linked to the Glock by ballistics evidence.

He said shootings on the block have left him numb. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) A gang's lifeblood With three months still to go in 2016, Chicago has already topped 530 homicides and 3,250 shootings, far more than in all of 2015. On so many levels, the cost of the runaway violence can be immeasurable. It has struck a blow to the city's psyche and national image and taken an emotional toll on survivors, the families of those killed and the larger community. Even the financial costs can be hard to fully tabulate. Taxpayers are sure to foot the bill for much of the hospital care for the thousands shot as well as the cost of law enforcement, including nearly 1,000 police officers being added to the department over the next two years. Just the public cost to investigate this one Glock's five shootings has been considerable. About 50 Chicago police officers responded to the shooting scenes, including technicians who checked for evidence and beat officers who guarded perimeters and talked to victims. Over the last decade, guns have accounted for a growing percentage of the city's homicides, a recent study by Lurie Children's Hospital found. In 2015, nearly nine out of every 10 homicides in Chicago involved guns, up 13 percentage points from just 10 years earlier, according to the study. Two factors make Chicago's gun violence distinct from other big cities \u2014 the strength and size of its street gangs as well as the easy access to firearms in neighboring states because of weak gun laws, said Philip Cook, professor of public policy at Duke University. \"Chicago ends up being surrounded by lax jurisdictions, and that makes it difficult to really control gun availability within the city,\" said Cook, who has studied Chicago's gun violence for years and written on the issue. \"That combined with the high violence rate (driven by gangs) \u2026 is the combination that is the killer, quite literally.\" Guns get to Chicago in many ways. In so-called straw purchases, those with a firearm owner's identification card can carve out a niche business buying guns in Illinois for felons barred from owning weapons because of their criminal records. Another option lies a few miles away over the border in Indiana, where gun shows require no background checks. A study in 2015 by the University of Chicago Crime Lab found 60 percent of the newer guns recovered from gang members had come from out of state \u2014 half of those from Indiana. In separate interviews done at Cook County Jail, gun offenders said gangs sometimes tapped members to make buying trips. \"All they need is one person who got a gun card in the 'hood and everybody got (a gun),\" the study quoted one inmate as saying. The Glock, though, was stolen on Jan. 17, 2014, from an apartment in the 1900 block of East 79th Street just four months after the owner purchased it legally at a Hoffman Estates Cabela's, the outdoor recreation chain. Nearly a year later, authorities recovered the gun only two blocks from where it had been stolen. The Glock was test-fired in the Police Department's forensics firearms unit and linked to 42 of the shell casings recovered at the five shootings, according to Anthony Riccio, chief of the Organized Crime Bureau. Gunmen had fired more than one weapon in two of the shootings. Police officials and gang experts said the gun would have been a hot commodity on the street because it was new and of much higher quality than so many of the 7,000 illegal guns seized in Chicago in 2014. According to numerous police records and interviews with researchers and Chicago police gang intelligence experts, the Glock appears to have been passed among members of the same gang. John J.

Drequan Archie was fatally shot, and another male was wounded. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Guns are the lifeblood of gangs, prized possessions often kept hidden away until needed, then handed out to any number of members who might be tapped to carry out a shooting, according to Riccio. Sometimes guns \"are kept under porches, kept in houses, hidden in traps in cars,\" he said. \"\u2026 They decide amongst themselves whose turn it is to pull the trigger, quite frankly.\" The shootings connected to the Glock hint at the epidemic of violence among gangs and the dilemma facing police. Three of the five victims who survived are themselves now locked up in Cook County Jail on unrelated charges. Many of the shooting victims were affiliated with the same gang and provided scant, if any, detail about who shot them, according to police and court records. None of the shootings has been solved.\n\n'Why I carry this banger' The trail of violence started on a porch in the 2700 block of East 76th Street on April 11, 2014, three months after and about a mile from where the Glock had been stolen. If you stretch your head up and gaze east from the porch's steps, you can see a bright blue stretch of Lake Michigan, just a few blocks away at Rainbow Beach. On the North Side, this would be prime real estate, but on this block, longtime residents say violence ebbs and flows. Strahan, 68, a retired electrician, said the violence was incessant a few years back when a gang controlled a corner store on the east end of the block. Two of those killings took place right across from his home, while three others died down the block, he said. \"This has been going on and escalating ever since my son was born 36 years ago. He is out of state. He got away. I am so glad he did,\" he said. On a recent warm evening, with the only noise coming from cicadas, he walked through his yard, pointing to bullet holes on the house next door and on his own brick home amid its blooming flowers in the front and a garden of tomatoes, beans, corn and cucumbers along the side. Strahan attributed most of the violence to gangs fighting over drug dealing. What led to the fatal shooting of Shannon Mack, a father of two, just a couple of doors down from Strahan's home remains uncertain, but during his autopsy, medical examiners found five plastic baggies containing a white powdery substance in Mack's mouth. Strahan said he had noticed earlier that night that a large group had gathered at the neighbor's house, hanging out on the porch. But Mack was alone on the front steps at 9:30 p.m. when someone approached and opened fire. To understand Chicago's violence, start at Kostner Avenue and Monroe Street and walk west up a one-way stretch of graystones and brick two-flats. There on a boarded-up front door you'll see the red stain of gang graffiti. On the cracked sidewalk below lies an empty heroin baggie. Hardened young... The crew of Fire Department Engine 126 found Mack unconscious, leaning against a porch railing. He was shot four times and pronounced dead at the scene. Four spent shell casings were recovered. At 34, Mack was the oldest of the Glock's seven victims. Court records show he had one felony drug conviction in 2003 and was sentenced to two years in prison for possessing a .380-caliber handgun in 2011. At the time of that arrest, he told officers he was carrying the gun for protection after someone he knew had been shot. \"These n------ out here are crazy. That's why I carry this banger,\" he said, according to the police report. Mack's former wife, Tanya Grant, with whom he had two sons, said he held much promise. He was smart and enjoyed writing rhyme and rap. But she wondered if like so many raised in Chicago's most troubled neighborhoods, he didn't have the resources to overcome the negative influences, opting instead to be the \"tough dude\" necessary to survive the mean streets. \"We don't have the answer,\" Grant said of what led to Mack's killing. \"It's a lot of pain in our communities. It's something that most people from the outside, they can't relate to. \u2026 Even though you try to cope and you try to heal the wound, you can't.\" 'Whatever God brings' Violence has become routine around 66th and State streets, but Ammar Awadh, the co-owner of a Citgo gas station at the corner just off the Dan Ryan Expressway, doesn't remember the shooting involving the Glock, the second one linked to the gun. According to police reports, a dark car pulled up beside another vehicle at the intersection about 12:45 a.m. Aug. 25, 2014. Someone in the dark car opened fire at the other vehicle. Two men in their early 20s were shot, one in the groin, the other in the thigh. The dark car fled north on State, and the victims drove themselves to the hospital. Both survived, police said. A dozen .40-caliber shell casings were recovered near the gas station. Another shooting in July of this year \u2014 not linked to the Glock \u2014 left a clerk at the station dead. When somebody put a gun on you, what you say? Nothing. Whatever God brings, welcome it. \u2014 Ammar Awadh Operating a business in this environment comes at a cost. Awadh said he has spent $10,000 on bulletproof glass protecting the cashier, $7,000 on surveillance cameras and $2,600 for added lighting. The business owner also has honed his street smarts \u2014 constantly reading customers to figure out if any pose a threat. \"Use your mind,\" he said of his strategy as he sat recently on a milk crate, the constant din of customers muffled behind the protective glass. \"Don't use your power.\" The shooting of his friend and co-worker has taken an emotional toll on Awadh, leading him to rely more heavily on his Muslim faith, he said. \"When somebody put a gun on you, what you say? Nothing,\" he said. \"Whatever God brings, welcome it.\" 'Help me, help me' The Glock's fourth victim, John Williams, insisted he had no idea why anyone would want to kill him. In a recent interview at Cook County Jail, where he is awaiting trial on an armed robbery charge, he acknowledged his lifestyle courted trouble, hanging out on the street too much. He had been shot once before, in December 2013, Williams said, but he denied being a gang member. Williams was on his way home from a friend's house on Oct. 25, 2014, when a car raced up behind his 2005 silver Grand Prix, and several people inside fired a fusillade of shots in the 2700 block of East 81st Street. As glass shattered, the 22-year-old grabbed his neck because of the stinging pain. He drove about a block before fleeing the car for help. \"It really don't matter who did it. I just want to know why. Why would anybody shoot me?\" Williams asked. \"I don't recall (doing anything) that would make anybody want to kill me.\" Police collected 38 shell casings at the scene. Thirteen had been fired from the Glock, while the rest came from two other guns used in the shooting. A woman who lived nearby came to Williams' aid, handing him a towel to try to stop the bleeding. \"He kept saying, 'Help me, help me,'\" said the neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of fear for her safety. \"He was crying. He said, 'I've been shot, I've been shot.'\" At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, doctors removed a bullet from his left arm that was wedged between two bones, leaving a thin seam of a scar running the length of his forearm. A bullet in the back of his neck could not be removed without risking further injury so doctors left it until muscle and tissue nudged it close enough to the surface of his skin. Doctors removed the bullet a month later, he said.

In July 2017, an off-duty New Castle County Police officer was leaving church in the 300 Block of North Van Buren Street when he was attacked by Sanchez and 3 other people. Investigation suggested that the attackers knew the victim was an off-duty officer when they attempted to rob him. Sanchez punched the officer and tried to get his gun during the altercation. Sanchez faces 6 to 52 years in prison when sentenced by a Superior Court judge in June. DOJ social worker Courtney Cochran and paralegal Jess Ascione worked on the case, and Matt Geiser of the Wilmington Police Department was the chief investigating officer.\n\nA former member of the Only My Brothers (OMB) gang pled guilty to drug and weapons charges, along with violating his probation on previous Gang Participation, Carrying a Concealed Deadly Weapon, and Aggravated Menacing convictions.

A search of Minus\u2019s home turned up drugs and a loaded semi-automatic handgun.

When the woman refused, he began to choke her and punch her in the face. The assault continued until the crew of an off-duty ambulance that was driving by saw and stopped the attack. Snow, considered a habitual offender due to past convictions on weapons, rioting, and reckless endangering charges, faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced by a Superior Court judge in July. Deputy Attorney General Jenna Milecki prosecuted the case, Lisa Rapko was the social worker, and Jayna Quillen was the paralegal.\n\nA plea to 6 felony charges could lead to an extended prison term for a 35-year-old Wilmington man.

His identity has not been released.\n\nThe weapon that prompted the evacuation turned out to be a homemade firearm, school officials said. They initially thought it could have been an explosive device and a law enforcement bomb squad was called to the school in the 9200 block of South Fry.\n\nA school staffer was told about a \"security threat\" - which led to the evacuation - after a regularly scheduled fire drill at 10:05 a.m. that had already sent more than 3,000 students out of the building, officials said.\n\nThe suspicious object was in the east section of the sprawling campus.\n\n\"The assistant principal said, 'This doesn't look right,' \" said Steve Stanford, a Katy ISD spokesman.\n\nWhen the students were moved the second time, they were directed to an area near the campus baseball and football fields.\n\n\"We thought it was just another drill. We didn't think much of it,\" said Sanjana Madakshire, 17, a senior.\n\nStudents spent several hours waiting to either return to school or be released.\n\nMadakshire said any information the students received came through word-of-mouth or their smart phones.\n\n\"They didn't tell us anything. I don't think they were sure of what to do,\" she said.\n\nWith the campus sealed off, police from several agencies, including FBI bomb squad agents, began sweeping the building and checking the suspicious device.\n\nBy 4 p.m., the campus was cleared of any danger. The device turned out to be a kind of firearm known as a zip gun. Such a weapon can be as crude as a pipe with a block of wood for a handle and a rubber band providing the power for a firing pin.\n\n\"They are things that are illegal - especially on a school campus,\" Stanford said.\n\nA rifle also was found in the trunk of the student's car in the school's parking lot, officials said.\n\nKaty ISD officials said the campus will be back to normal on Tuesday although any quizzes and tests scheduled for that day are postponed.", "publish_date": "2014-01-13"}, {"text": "INCIDENT #1: At about 1:30 PM on Wednesday, March 14, 2018, officers from District B-3 (Mattapan) were patrolling the area of 1635 Blue Hill Avenue when they observed a brown Nissan Altima occupied by four individuals travelling on the public way in front of them.
