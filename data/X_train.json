The judge noted that he was not making any finding of fact, but rather simply summarizing what was alleged to have happened.\n\nAfter the officer sprayed Taylor with mace there was a scuffle and Taylor was shot four times and the officer once in the leg with his own weapon. Court documents indicated that Taylor was alleged to have jumped in front of Ambrifi's patrol car.\n\nIn 2015, Taylor filed a civil lawsuit against Ambrifi, the municipality and others in U.S. District Court in Camden that is still pending, according to court records. In the suit, Taylor alleged that Ambrifi was not properly trained and had used excessive force against him during the altercation.\n\nTaylor, who has been in jail since June 2013, had lost an appeal in July to have the indictment dismissed because the grand jury did not consider his mental issues. A psychological evaluation determined that Taylor is schizophrenic and family and friends said he became obsessed with religion and even death in the days before the incident, according to court documents.\n\nA trial date had been set for January, but Taylor opted instead for the bench trial. Before Delehey ruled that Taylor was not guilty because he was mentally incapacitated during the incident, did not understand the nature of his conduct, and could not determine right from wrong, the state and defense agreed to certain conditions.\n\nBurlington County Assistant Prosecutor Thaddeus Drummond said the state agreed to dismiss all counts of the indictment, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, except for a third-degree offense of resisting arrest. That was the only offense considered by the judge during the trial.\n\nAlso, both sides agreed that Taylor will be sent to a psychiatric facility under what is known as Krol status until June 2018 and will waive his right for two years after that to challenge any finding by mental health professionals that he continue to be committed if he is deemed a risk to himself or others.\n\nThose on Krol status are evaluated annually by a judge to determine if they are a danger to themselves or society and should remain committed.", "publish_date": "2017-12-14"}, {"text": "You are the owner of this article.", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "Pictured: The two male victims of OC student, 20, who gunned down a woman in his family home before stealing five cars to go on a bloody 25-minute murder spree\n\nSuspect identified as 20-year-old Ali Syed, an unemployed college student\n\n\n\nFirst victim was unidentified woman in her 20s at his parents' home in Ladera Ranch\n\nOther victims identified as construction worker Jeremy Lewis, 26, and business owner Melvin Lee Edwards, 69\n\n\n\nPolice report at least five crime scenes of dead or injured victims\n\nSyed was also shooting at passing cars on the freeway\n\n\n\nGunman followed by cops as he drove to middle of an intersection, where he got out of his car and shot himself\n\n\n\nMurderer: Ali Syed killed three people and himself in the bloody shooting spree in California\n\nThe two male victims of a 20-year-old college student were identified on Tuesday night after they were shot dead in the street during a murder and carjacking spree.\n\n\n\nBusiness owner Melvin Lee Edwards, 69, was on his way to work when he crossed paths with shooter Ali Syed, of Ladera Ranch, California and was killed 'execution-style', witnesses said .\n\nThe second male victim, 26-year-old construction worker Jeremy Lewis of Fullerton, was killed a short time later at an electronics store and his small truck carjacked.\n\n\n\nSyed was identified by police on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the early morning massacre which began at his family home.\n\nHis first victim, described as a woman in her 20s, was not identified.\n\n\n\nShe was not related to the shooter and it is unclear what she was doing at the home.\n\nSyed's 25-minute shooting spree through Orange County left a bloody trail of dead and injured victims in a series of carjackings and gunfire, police said.\n\nAuthorities reported at least five places where victims had been shot in the early morning violence - and at least four are dead - including Syed who took his own life.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said Syed was taking one course at Saddleback College, a two-year community college.\n\n\n\nThe shootings began at 4.45am when deputies responding to a call found the body of a female who was shot multiple times in a house in Ladera Ranch, Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.\n\nPolice said Syed's parents and several children were in the home at the time, but were not injured.\n\nFrom Ladera Ranch, police said the gunman, armed with a shotgun, headed north and within 30 minutes carjacked a Dodge pickup truck in Tustin, 20 miles away.

He received an additional 93 years suspended upon numerous conditions.\n\nYates also has an additional five years to serve on Nottoway County convictions this year for grand larceny and breaking and entering.\n\nAccording to Commonwealth Attorney Robert Clement, a jury trial was planned for November 4th and 5th, but the defendant expressed a willingness to plead guilty in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence. Clement said that he would have preferred a more significant sentence, but due to a \u201csnitch\u201d mentality among nearly all of the witnesses, he felt more secure with a \u201csure thing\u201d rather than having to count upon reluctant, uncooperative witnesses. \u201cSome refused to talk to law enforcement, and some refused to meet with me,\u201d said Clement. The prosecutor did, however, highly commend one of the victims, Standrekas Woods, for his full cooperation, precise observations, and ability to express his testimony fully and forcefully. Clement added that the victims and law enforcement officers agreed to the disposition.\n\n\u201cIronically, those persons who did not want to \u201csnitch\u201d did not realize that Yates \u201csnitched\u201d on one of his closest friends, Robert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields, the driver of the vehicle. In his interview in Texas where he was found after the shooting, Yates said he had left the party before the shootings, and that Fields had given him the gun to take to Texas later that day. He said Fields admitted to him in a telephone conversation that Fields had shot the men.\n\nFields, on the other hand, would not identify Yates as the shooter in his first four interviews until he was shown the video of Yates in Texas blaming him for the shooting. Fields then went ballistic, calling Yates a liar and saying Yates was the shooter. He then looked right into the camera in the interview room and shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re (deleted) whacked. You are lying. You\u2019re supposed to be my (deleted) brother, man.\u201d He told the investigator to be sure she showed Yates the video of this interview. \u201cDon\u2019t let him miss it.\u201d He then raised his hands up, showing the handcuffs to the camera, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because of you.\u201d\u201d\n\nYates will be under conditions of good behavior for 118 years, supervised probation for five years upon his release, warrant-less searches and seizures, no contact with the victims, restitution for any medical expenses, not knowingly being within 100 feet of any firearms except law enforcement officers and commercial establishments, and staying out of Lunenburg County for ten years upon his release.\n\nAccording to Clement, the charges arose from a shooting at 2073 Pleasant Oak Road, Victoria, Virginia after physical altercations between Lunenburg men and Nottoway men during a birthday party for a Lunenburg female on May 18, 2013.\n\nDetails provided below were taken from a written Stipulation of Evidence signed by the defendant as to what he expected the Commonwealth to prove in court, revealed the following facts:\n\nAll witnesses would have been in agreement that Richsean Hawkes hosted a birthday party cookout for Destiny Brown, a friend. Approximately 25 to 35 individuals eventually showed up.\n\nA number of the witnesses became aware that around 11:30 p.m., Robert \u201cChuckie\u201d Fields drove up in his father\u2019s minivan with six friends from Nottoway. (Fields is the father of the baby of Destiny Brown). A number of the witnesses expressed concern that the \u201cNottoway\u201d men had come to the party, because of past tensions with Lunenburg County individuals. They would testify that Brandon Townsend of Lunenburg stood on the front porch at one point and angrily yelled at one of the Nottoway men, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d because of the manner and stance that the Nottoway man posed. Townsend was convinced by some of the women to go back into the house, but came out later and fussed again. One of the Nottoway men yelled something to the effect of not being disrespected in this way. As some of the Lunenburg and Nottoway men became more aggressive, some of the Lunenburg men and women tried to defuse the situation and calm them down. Two of these men who tried to calm things down were the victims, Stan Woods and Dequan Jones. Witnesses would say that Dequan Jones was then jumped and hit from the side, and then fought back. As he was fighting, another Nottoway man tried to get him, but a Lunenburg man pushed him away, and said words to the effect that it would have to be a fair fight, one on one. He pushed the Nottoway man twice to stop him, and they ended up in the road in front of the house. They squared off with each other to fight, and the Lunenburg man hit him in the face with one punch and knocked him out. Stan encouraged Chuckie Fields to get his friend and leave. Chuckie dragged his friend to the minivan, put him inside, and the other Nottoway men got inside also.\n\n(Some of the Nottoway men said the minivan was surrounded and being hit and kicked, but none of the Commonwealth\u2019s Lunenburg witnesses confirmed this.)\n\nAt this point, shots were fired. Five or six witnesses would testify that the shots came from inside the minivan which was parked at the back of the driveway facing the house, with five shots fired through the windshield, and two more shots fired from the side after the van had backed into the road and as it drove away.\n\nThe four victims were hit by the gunfire as described below.\n\nStandrekas \u201cStan\u201d Woods is a 2009 graduate of Central High School, and attended one year at the local community college before becoming a correctional officer for the Virginia Department of Corrections.\n\nStan said that around 11:00 pm or 11:30 p.m., his friend, Richsean Hawkes, called and asked him to come to his house and drive him to town to buy some cigarettes because he had been drinking and did not want to drive. When he came back, he sat on the porch talking to Hawkes and one of the Nottoway men in friendly conversation.\n\nWhen the arguments began, Stan stopped one Lunenburg man from being aggressive toward the Nottoway man who had been on the porch, pointing out that he had not done anything.\n\nStan then went to get his younger brother, Dontaris, in order to leave. He saw the fights described above, and peacefully encouraged the Nottoway men to leave. He and his brother walked to his car in the driveway where it was parked just in front of the minivan. He walked around the front of the car, and Dontaris walked behind the car calling out for a friend who had ridden with him. His car was parked on the road further beyond the driveway.\n\nStan said that as he put the key in lock to the door of his car, he heard two shots, and saw his brother, Dontaris, fall to the ground. He then turned and looked at the minivan, saw two bullet holes in the windshield, and plainly saw the defendant, Codarrell Yates, pointing a handgun toward him from inside the minivan from the back, reaching between the two front seats. The ceiling light was on just above his face, giving Stan a good view of Yates. Stan said Yates yelled, \u201cTHAT\u2019S HOW YA\u2019LL WANT TO PLAY ? AIN\u2019T NO REASON TO RUN NOW.\u201d\n\nStan said he could see Chuckie (Robert Fields) in the driver\u2019s seat, and the light-skinned guy in the passenger seat.\n\nStan said YATES looked at him dead in the face, pointing the gun at him.\n\nSTAN yelled \u201cNO!!!\u201d and saw and heard the shot fired by Yates and felt the bullet hit him in the chest.\n\nSTAN sank down by the car, and played dead. He said he heard two more shots, and then a few seconds later he heard two more shots down the road just as the van accelerated and drove away.\n\nStan looked up and saw they were gone. He said he ran around the car and went up to the sidewalk where he fell.\n\nA friend and other Lunenburg men and women got shirts, towels and sheets and applied pressure to the wounds of the four victims.\n\nStan said he looked up at the moon, which was nearly full, and thought, \u201cThis is the last moon I\u2019m going to see.\u201d\n\nStan was driven to the hospital in South Hill along with Trey Ghee, who had been injured. Dequan Jones and Dontaris Woods were driven to the Victoria Rescue Squad and transported to South Hill. All four men were then transported to MCV Hospital in Richmond.\n\nDequan Jones also attended Central High School. He would testify concerning the fighting described above, and said he then walked over to his car which was parked a little further up the driveway in front of Stan.

It turned out that a bullet had cut his earlobe and either the same bullet or a second bullet entered the side of his head at the ear while his head was turned sideways. He said he did not see the shooting itself.\n\nDontaris Woods apparently was the first man shot, but said he did not see the shooting itself. He was struck in the face and in his left arm near the wrist.\n\nTreyvious Ghee said he came out of the house and saw the fighting going on.

He is charged as an accomplice (for driving the vehicle as the last shots were fired and getting away from the scene, allowing Yates to flee). He is charged with the same crimes as Yates, except for the possession of a firearm by a felon.\n\nFields was interviewed by law enforcement at least four times, refusing to identify the shooter, at times stating he just heard the shots and ducked down in the driver\u2019s seat, and stating that one of the friends was still unconscious from being knocked out in the fight, and another friend in the front passenger seat fainted when the first shot rang out. He always strongly denied that he had shot the gun. He later said that the police knew who had shot the gun, but he would not say the name.\n\nIn exchange for his agreement to testify against Yates and his agreement to waive the preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth has agreed to allow Fields to plead guilty to one count of malicious wounding as an accomplice and receive one year active sentence.\n\nYates fled to Texas later in the day, driven by a female friend, Deidre Fowlkes. When found by law enforcement officers in Arlington, Texas, Yates ran on foot, and tried to hide in some brush. A tracking dog was used, and he was found lying in some tall grass. At first he would not get up as commanded, but when police threatened to release the dog, he jumped up.

Each of the three face 20 years to life in prison when they are sentenced in January.\n\nTheir joint plea deals with prosecutors do not require them to testify against the lone FnD member still facing trial, their older brother, Travis \"Trap\" Scott, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Payne said. Travis Scott is set to go to trial next month as the alleged leader of FnD.\n\nNew Orleans Police say Akein Scott, 22, and Shawn Scott, 26, took up positions on opposite sides of Frenchmen Street as the May 12, 2013 parade passed near North Villere Street, and opened fire at a rival gang member, identified in court records by the initials \"J.T.\"\n\nThe melee was retaliation for a prior shooting that wounded Stanley Scott by members of the Prieur and Columbus Boys, a rival gang also known as \"PCB,\" police said.\n\nNineteen bystanders were wounded, including J.T., who was struck five times, according to court records filed along with Akein, Stanley and Shawn Scott's guilty pleas. Another person was trampled as panicked parade-goers fled the shooting.\n\nProsecutors allege FnD members trafficked heroin and crack cocaine in the 7th Ward dating back to 2006. Nine FnD members, most of them members of the Scott family, were charged in a federal indictment in 2014.\n\nSurveillance video showed the densely packed crowd along the parade route scattering amid the gunshots, images that shocked even city residents accustomed to occasional outbreaks of violence along parade routes.\n\nAmong the those struck by bullets were two 10-year-old children, who suffered graze wounds. The shooter shown in the video, according to court records, was then 20-year-old Akein Scott.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, organizers hosted a \"do over\" of the parade and multiple fundraisers were held for the injured even as police conducted a manhunt for the shooting suspects.\n\nIn court records, FnD members who have pleaded guilty have admitted to selling drugs over a territory bounded by Elysian Fields Avenue, North Johnson, Interstate 10, St. Anthony Street and North Claiborne Avenue.\n\nThe center of the gang's operation was the Frenchmen Meat Market, where workers would hold guns behind the counter for FnD members, and would let patrons swap food stamps for cash that they then handed over to FnD members for heroin or crack.\n\nSurveillance video from the store's own cameras was noted as evidence prosecutors intended to use at trial, with footage showing FnD members making numerous drug deals inside the store.\n\nTravis Scott often carried an AK-47 rifle he called \"monkey nuts,\" a reference to the massive drum magazine that could hold 100 rounds, according to court records.\n\nAkein Scott, now 22, sold drugs at the store several days a week, mostly in the afternoon after returning from school, one unnamed witness said in court records. As one of the younger members of the gang, Akein often was told to hang onto firearms for older gang members, because as a juvenile, he would face less serious penalties from authorities if he was caught with the weapons.\n\nIn court records, Akein Scott admitted to pulling the trigger himself in four shootings during the year before the 2013 Mother's Day parade, joining Shawn and Stanley Scott in a shootout in front of the Frenchmen Meat Market in which a 14-year-old girl riding in a passing vehicle was shot in the leg.\n\nOn Mother's Day 2013, Akein Scott is seen on surveillance video as the second-line parade moves down the block, stepping out from the side of a building with a pistol raised and firing into the terrified marchers, according to court records.\n\nWhen asked about his background by Judge Lemelle on Wednesday, Akein Scott was the only one of the brothers to have completed high school, stating that he attended college in \"Talladega\" and studied business administration.

Kirk\n\n\n\nIts funny how everyone wants to blame everyone except the people actually involved. These shootings that have been happening are all gang related. If you're a parent of one of these delinquents then you should know whether or not your child is in a gang. And if you dont then you're not doing your job. If they're living in your house which most of them probably are, then there should be no privacy. if you find guns, drugs or colors in their room then you need to act. if not, you're just as guilty when they pull the trigger or get shot because they were wearing the wrong color or the drug deal goes south. And to all the people that know who is in a gang and dont report them, youre just as guilty. Gangs breed violence and crime. Nothing good comes of them and if you're in one then you're an idiot. If you want power and respect and a sense of pride, join the military, learn a trade. And if you really want to shoot someone then go infantry or marines. Law enforcement cant do it on their own.

I am a single parent of two teenagers (boy and girl). I try my very best to instill positive values that were taught to me by my grandparents, parents and numerous others. But, society today as a whole, has changed altogether. Yes, we say that we need role models and more people getting involved with the lives of theses children and I totally agree. Now, you have some parents that try to be their child's friend rather than raise them. I do believe that there should be a bond between you and your children, but define your boundaries. Don't uphold your children in their wrong doings, chastise them. Make it a priority to read and understand the Bible (ex. GOING TO CHURCH), have a family sit down meal, doing family outings, and pray together. Provide positive results is all that I am saying. Do not let them raise you!!!!! I remember when I was younger, if I even looked like I wanted to step out of line with my parents or grandparents, I would get dealt with then (and it was not a time out or punishment). Now, some of these parents do not want you to say anything to their children. If you do, then you are wrong. So, in my opinion only, this is what the result will be. Without GOD in our lives daily, we will never make it in this world.

The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.\n\nThe memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it\u2019s the parking lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals.

Teutonia Ave., police said Saturday.\n\nThe four victims have been hospitalized for non-life threatening injuries, Capt. Donald Gaglione said. The motive for the shooting is under investigation, he said.\n\nThe incident happened overnight Friday into Saturday. A news release from Milwaukee police did not indicate a specific time of the shooting.\n\nLake Superior water level jumps in May\n\nA new report says the level of Lake Superior has made a big jump.\n\nThe International Lake Superior Board of Control reported Friday that the level of Lake Superior jumped 9 inches in May. That's more than twice the normal monthly increase and the second most for any month since 1918.\n\nLake Superior usually rises only about 4 inches each May. But thanks to late snow and a cold spring that held back runoff, May more than made up for the difference.\n\nThe lake now sits just 7 inches below its long-term average for June 1. It is a full 3 inches above the level at this time last year.\n\nThe Duluth News Tribune reports Lakes Huron and Michigan also continued their rise from near-record lows in late winter.\n\nDeath of toddler probed in West Allis\n\nWest Allis police late Saturday were investigating the death of a 21-month-old child.\n\nPolice were called to a mobile home in the 10300 block of W. Greenfield Ave. at 4:15 p.m. for an unresponsive child.\n\nAttempts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful.\n\nPolice and the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office are investigating.\n\nNo other details were provided.\n\nPolice arrest man for making threat\n\nA 39-year-old man accused of making a threat to a Greenfield resident was taken into custody Saturday by Oak Creek police.\n\nThe alleged threat was made about 10 a.m. Police said the man ran into a residence in the 2100 block of W. College Ave. and refused to comply with orders from Oak Creek police officers.\n\nAfter contacting the man on the phone, officers persuaded him to come out of the house.\n\nHe was taken into custody and will be medically evaluated, police said.\n\nThe Milwaukee County district attorney's office will review the case to determine if charges are warranted.\n\nFree swim lessons offered at Wilson Park\n\nThe Milwaukee County Park System and the Southwest Aquatic Team's Swim America Program are offering free Milwaukee County pool open swim summer passes for the first 200 swimmers who register for lessons at the Wilson Park Pool, near W. Howard Ave. and S. 25th St. in Milwaukee.\n\nThose who sign up will also get a free swimming cap and a free pair of goggles.\n\nDale Schrank, the program's director, said he hopes the lessons at Wilson Park Pool will encourage minority youths to learn swimming, as African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately represented in drowning deaths. He said Swim America would like to offer lessons at more locations attracting minorities.\n\nParents who would like to register their children can send checks to SWAT Swim America, P.O. Box 138, Muskego, WI 53150. Alternatively, they can register in person on June 4 or June 6 at the Wilson Park and Recreation Center from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. For more information on the lessons, email swatt@execpc.com or call (262) 971-1658.\n\nIllinois firm to provide cream puff ingredient\n\nWisconsin State Fair-goers may be surprised to learn the main ingredient in a favorite fair treat no longer comes from the dairy state.\n\nThe Wisconsin Bakers' Association has turned to an Illinois company to provide the cream that makes the fair's cream puffs so popular. Prairie Farms Dairy of Carlinville, Ill., won a contract to supply the cream after Golden Guernsey went out of business in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Bakers' Association found no Wisconsin company could handle the daily demand of 1,200 gallons of cream.\n\nState Fair spokeswoman Kristi Chuckel told WISN-TV that Prairie Farms has pledged to work with Wisconsin dairy farms to supply the cream. But, for fairgoer Jeff Fink, it just leaves a bad taste in his mouth.\n\nFink equates it to the Packers moving to Illinois. He says \"there's something just not right about it.\"\n\nTraffic stop reveals heroin, drugs in car\n\nA Milwaukee woman faces felony drug charges after her car was stopped for a traffic violation in Racine County, where police say they found marijuana, pills and about $4,500 worth of heroin in her car.\n\nThe 27-year-old woman \u2014 who was a passenger in her vehicle, being driven by someone else \u2014 was not identified in a news release from Racine County Sheriff's Office. She is being held in the Racine County jail on charges of possession of marijuana, possession of a controlled substance and possession of heroin with intent to deliver.\n\nAccording to the release, a deputy stopped the car on northbound I-94 early Saturday for an unspecified traffic violation. The deputy smelled burned marijuana, searched the vehicle and found the drugs.\n\nThe driver was not charged and was released.\n\nDeSoto campsites closed temporarily\n\nDeSoto \u2014 A southwestern Wisconsin park is offering only limited camping this weekend due to minor flooding.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Blackhawk Park near DeSoto has extremely wet conditions.\n\nIn addition, the Corps will close sites 40 to 73 of the West Loop Camping Area Monday through Thursday to do maintenance work.\n\nThe Corps said with the flooding and this closure, the number of campsites at Blackhawk Park will be limited. Campers should contact park staff before planning a camping trip.\n\nThe Corps plans to reopen the West Loop for next weekend and other sites as river levels recede and conditions improve.\n\nJournal Sentinel staff and wires", "publish_date": ""}, {"text": "The first year of a divided Congress got off to an inauspicious start on the federal budget, as the House and Senate both failed to approve a budget framework for 2020 before going home for a two week Easter break, continuing a less than stellar bipartisan record of action on spending and deficits on Capitol Hill in recent years. 'Last year was a historically bad year for the Congressional budget process,' said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, noting it was the first time since 1976 that neither the House nor the Senate voted on a budget resolution. 'Unfortunately, this only adds to a poor budget record,' the group added. One important point before we get too deep into Legislative Nerd Territory - the term 'budget' does not relate to actual spending, but rather to what's known as the 'budget resolution,' which is a budget outline - a framework - for what Congress will do later in the year, filling in the blanks with the specifics of spending choices. As the CFRB notes, this year is not getting off to a good start on the budget, which is even more troublesome given the divided nature of Congress, with Democrats in charge of the House, and Republicans leading the Senate. And the forecast is for a difficult budget year - which many believe might end up in another government shutdown in October, and a possible across-the-board sequester soon after. Here's just some of what gone on, and what to look for on Capitol Hill. 1. Divided House Democrats punt on 2020 budget. Just like Republicans in the House struggled for years to balance the interests of more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus and more moderate GOP lawmakers, Democrats have the same balancing act. More liberal members want to do big things in the budget. More moderate 'Blue Dog' Democrats want a more middle ground on spending. And so, Democrats had to give up plans last week to vote on a bill to raise the caps on federal spending for the next two years by nearly $350 billion. Progressives didn't like it because it spent too much on defense, at $733 billion. Meanwhile, some more moderate Democrats were talking about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The internal Democratic Party dustup was music to ears of Republicans, who chortled about the Democrats running into the Legislative Ditch. 2. Senate Republicans didn't vote on their budget outline either. While Republicans chuckled at the failure of Democrats to force a vote on their budget plan for 2020, GOP Senators didn't even try to act on their budget resolution before the April 15 deadline. The Senate GOP budget resolution would reduce future planned spending increases by over a half billion dollars, but it wouldn't come close to the defense spending levels backed by President Trump - who wants $750 billion for defense. House Democrats have proposed $733 billion, while the Senate Republican budget would have funding for the military set at $643 billion, well below the President's request. And so, for a second straight year, there was no budget vote-a-rama in the Senate on the non-binding budget resolution. 3. The Defense Budget Gimmick used by both parties. With budget caps in place that limit how much you can spend on the military and non-defense items in the budget, Congress is still doing its best to get around those limits, especially for the military, by using an extra fund known as OCO - which stands for Overseas Contingency Operations. For example, President Trump's 2020 budget would put $174 billion in the OCO fund - more money than almost all other federal agencies - in order to get to a $750 billion budget for the Pentagon. Democrats have $69 billion in OCO, with Senate Republicans at $67 billion. If there's no deal on raising the budget caps, then the most money which could be spent on the Pentagon is $576 billion - unless, you get around that with the OCO $174 billion. 'OCO would be the 2nd largest federal agency, if it was an agency,' grumbled the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, as many say it's nothing but a slush fund. 4. McConnell, Pelosi want to negotiate a new budget deal. Even as Democrats were running aground on their effort to pass a bill which increases the spending caps, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to start talks on a budget agreement, as both parties know full well they need to get going now in order to have any chance of an across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. If you look at graphic just above this bullet point, you will see the figure of $576 billion for the Pentagon, and $542 billion for non-defense spending - those are the 'spending caps' set in law by a 2011 bipartisan budget deal. Current funding is much more than that, at $716 billion for the Pentagon and $605 billion for non-defense spending. The last three deals on the budget caps have raised the amount of spending each time - and the President may not go for that this time around. 5. Looming over all of this is a sequester. The reason lawmakers want to reach a 'spending caps' agreement is that the Budget Act of 2011 is still on the books, and if there is no agreement on the amount of money to spend in 2020, then an across-the-board budget cut known as the 'sequester' will kick in. And that would be a very big deal. If a sequester hits, the military budget would technically have go down from $716 billion to $576 billion - a cut of $140 billion. If the sequester kicks in, domestic spending would be trimmed from $605 billion to $542 billion. Ironically, because of the big increase that the GOP Congress was able to give to the Pentagon in 2017 and 2018, a sequester would hurt the military more than non-defense spending in 2020 and beyond. This is where the OCO funding (look above) comes into play - President Trump could allow the sequester to kick in, but still funnel more money to the Pentagon through that extra fund. One problem with that game plan is the GOP probably would not have 60 votes in the Senate to get that done. This may get pretty messy in the months ahead.", "publish_date": "2013-02-22"}, {"text": "Authorities were asking for the public\u2019s help in identifying suspects involved in the shooting and wounding of four men outside a Lancaster concert venue early Saturday.\n\nThe incident occurred about 2 a.m. after an altercation among patrons of Industry Theater in the 43000 block of Business Center Parkway spilled into the parking lot and gunfire erupted, according to Lt.
