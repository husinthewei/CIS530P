       "  'text': 'AURORA — Sonny Archuleta was a talented guy, an artist who filled his garage walls with graffiti murals and fashioned molten glass into pipes and bongs, according to neighbors.\\n\\nBut Archuleta, 33, apparently went over the edge on Saturday, killing three before police shot him to death after he opened fire on them from the townhouse where he lived with his wife, Stephanie Philbrook Archuleta, 30.\\n\\nPolice have not officially identified the gunman, or his victims, who were found dead in the home after the six-hour standoff ended Saturday morning. But neighbors and other sources say the shooter was Archuleta, and that the victims were his wife”s father, Anthony Ticali, her sister, Stacie Philbrook and Philbrook”s boyfriend.\\n\\nPhilbrook Archuleta escaped the home by jumping from the second floor window. She didn”t want to talk to media, her mother, Shannon Ticali, said Sunday.\\n\\n“Stephanie needs to grieve the loss of her sister and dad,” Ticali said.\\n\\nAfter escaping from the home, Philbrook Archuleta told police her husband was mentally unbalanced, according to a police source. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the gunman was a methamphetamine user.\\n\\nThe Archuletas rented the townhouse from Stacie Philbrook, and had lived there together for about a year, said Melissa Wright, 33, who lives across an alley from the townhouse in the 16000 block of East Ithaca Place.\\n\\nThey were an “odd-couple,” said Wright, a registered nurse at the Medical Center of Aurora, who worked at a drug rehabilitation facility in the past. “His eyes were always dilated, he was very loud and running around all the time. I”m a nurse, my job is to assess people and he seemed like he was on drugs.\\n\\n“She didn”t seem anything like that, she was very reserved. She seemed like a good girl; Stacie, too,” Wright said of Philbrook Archuleta and her sister.\\n\\nDoug Welch, a neighbor, said he frequently saw Archuleta outside the house working on his motorcycle. Inside the couple”s garage, Welch said, he could see large murals that Archuleta had painted.\\n\\nWright said Archuleta built the motorcycle himself, and practiced glass blowing. “He was a talented guy.”\\n\\nThe couple had been married for at least seven years, said a woman who knows the family, but asked that her name not be used because she didn”t want to speak for them.\\n\\n“Sonny and Stephanie definitely loved each other,” Ticali said. They were married in a civil ceremony by a justice of the peace, but on their second anniversary the couple tied the knot again at a religious ceremony at the Word of Life Christian Center, Ticali said.\\n\\nPhilbrook Archuleta worked at the Word of Life Academy, a day-care and tutoring center at the church in Lone Tree.\\n\\n“We need to pray for Stephanie. The loss of her sister, husband and other family member is beyond our understanding,” Senior Pastor Mark Bagwell said at Sunday services.',\n",

       "  'text': 'ALBUQUERQUE QUINTUPLE MURDERS: According to KOB, friends identified Greg Griego, a former pastor of Calvary Albuquerque Church, as the adult male who was killed at 2806 Long Lane in southwest Albuquerque, along with an adult female, a juvenile boy and two juvenile girls. Nehemiah Griego, 15, has been charged with two counts of murder, three counts of child abuse leading to murder. Pastor Greg Griego also works as a chaplain at the Metropolitan Detention Center. The home is owned by Gregory Griego and Sarah Griego, who was also killed, along with their three youngest children. Sarah Griego was a stay-at-home mom who homeschooled her kids.\\n\\nKOB 4 reports Nehemiah Griego called someone after the shootings and that person called 911. It is also being reported that Greg Griego was a spiritual counselor to the Albuquerque Fire Department. Greg Griego is the brother of former state Sen. Eric Griego. The family issued a statement saying, “Our family is grieving this terrible tragedy. We appreciate the prayers and support we have received and request that the media honor our family’s privacy during this difficult time.”\\n\\nThis latest mass shooting comes a little over a month after Adam Lanza killed 20 children, ages six and seven, as well as six educators during a shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT. This also comes as gun rights supporters staged “Gun Appreciation Day” Saturday all over the country. It will be interesting to hear the debate that will ensue from this tragedy tomorrow. Once again, more senseless murders.\\n\\nThe Albuquerque Journal reports that neighbor Peter Gomez said he saw the boy walk with siblings and his parents through the neighborhood regularly, and he “wore nothing but camouflage stuff”. Greg Griego turned his life around after being in a gang.\\n\\nGriego reportedly served in Desert Storm, and Nehemiah told neighbors he wanted to be a soldier. He always wore army clothing and camouflage, but he wasn’t allowed to play violent video games, according to one neighbor, since the boy’s parents didn’t allow anything “dirty or violent” and limited TV watching.\\n\\nUPDATE#1 (01/21/2013): The four remaining victims killed during Nehemiah Griego’s shooting rampage identified as mother Sarah Greigo, 40, and his three youngest siblings Zephania Griego, 9; Jael Griego, 5; and Angelina Griego, 2.',\n",

Some of the words the suspects used leads us to believe that it could have gang motivated,” Brentwood Police Department Captain Tom Hanson told KCBS.\\n\\n“However, we have no reason to believe that the victims are engaged in gang activity, affiliated, or gang members at all,” said Hanson.\\n\\nHe said that although Brentwood is “not immune” to gang activity, it is rare in the town of about 52,000.\\n\\n“This is something that doesn’t happen often in Brentwood, so obviously we’re shocked and we’re going to work diligently to identify who did this,” Hansen said.\\n\\nAn investigation into the shooting is under way and police are attempting to identify witnesses that might lead them to the suspects.\\n\\nA description of the suspects was not immediately available. Police have described their vehicle as a white or light-colored, late-model four-door sedan.\\n\\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Brentwood police Detective Aguirre at (925) 809-7726 or Detective Folena at (925) 809-7743.\\n\\n(Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

       "  'text': \"The first year of a divided Congress got off to an inauspicious start on the federal budget, as the House and Senate both failed to approve a budget framework for 2020 before going home for a two week Easter break, continuing a less than stellar bipartisan record of action on spending and deficits on Capitol Hill in recent years. 'Last year was a historically bad year for the Congressional budget process,' said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, noting it was the first time since 1976 that neither the House nor the Senate voted on a budget resolution. 'Unfortunately, this only adds to a poor budget record,' the group added. One important point before we get too deep into Legislative Nerd Territory - the term 'budget' does not relate to actual spending, but rather to what's known as the 'budget resolution,' which is a budget outline - a framework - for what Congress will do later in the year, filling in the blanks with the specifics of spending choices. As the CFRB notes, this year is not getting off to a good start on the budget, which is even more troublesome given the divided nature of Congress, with Democrats in charge of the House, and Republicans leading the Senate. And the forecast is for a difficult budget year - which many believe might end up in another government shutdown in October, and a possible across-the-board sequester soon after. Here's just some of what gone on, and what to look for on Capitol Hill. 1. Divided House Democrats punt on 2020 budget. Just like Republicans in the House struggled for years to balance the interests of more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus and more moderate GOP lawmakers, Democrats have the same balancing act. More liberal members want to do big things in the budget. More moderate 'Blue Dog' Democrats want a more middle ground on spending. And so, Democrats had to give up plans last week to vote on a bill to raise the caps on federal spending for the next two years by nearly $350 billion. Progressives didn't like it because it spent too much on defense, at $733 billion. Meanwhile, some more moderate Democrats were talking about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The internal Democratic Party dustup was music to ears of Republicans, who chortled about the Democrats running into the Legislative Ditch. 2. Senate Republicans didn't vote on their budget outline either. While Republicans chuckled at the failure of Democrats to force a vote on their budget plan for 2020, GOP Senators didn't even try to act on their budget resolution before the April 15 deadline. The Senate GOP budget resolution would reduce future planned spending increases by over a half billion dollars, but it wouldn't come close to the defense spending levels backed by President Trump - who wants $750 billion for defense. House Democrats have proposed $733 billion, while the Senate Republican budget would have funding for the military set at $643 billion, well below the President's request. And so, for a second straight year, there was no budget vote-a-rama in the Senate on the non-binding budget resolution. 3. The Defense Budget Gimmick used by both parties. With budget caps in place that limit how much you can spend on the military and non-defense items in the budget, Congress is still doing its best to get around those limits, especially for the military, by using an extra fund known as OCO - which stands for Overseas Contingency Operations. For example, President Trump's 2020 budget would put $174 billion in the OCO fund - more money than almost all other federal agencies - in order to get to a $750 billion budget for the Pentagon. Democrats have $69 billion in OCO, with Senate Republicans at $67 billion. If there's no deal on raising the budget caps, then the most money which could be spent on the Pentagon is $576 billion - unless, you get around that with the OCO $174 billion. 'OCO would be the 2nd largest federal agency, if it was an agency,' grumbled the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, as many say it's nothing but a slush fund. 4. McConnell, Pelosi want to negotiate a new budget deal. Even as Democrats were running aground on their effort to pass a bill which increases the spending caps, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to start talks on a budget agreement, as both parties know full well they need to get going now in order to have any chance of an across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. If you look at graphic just above this bullet point, you will see the figure of $576 billion for the Pentagon, and $542 billion for non-defense spending - those are the 'spending caps' set in law by a 2011 bipartisan budget deal. Current funding is much more than that, at $716 billion for the Pentagon and $605 billion for non-defense spending. The last three deals on the budget caps have raised the amount of spending each time - and the President may not go for that this time around. 5. Looming over all of this is a sequester. The reason lawmakers want to reach a 'spending caps' agreement is that the Budget Act of 2011 is still on the books, and if there is no agreement on the amount of money to spend in 2020, then an across-the-board budget cut known as the 'sequester' will kick in. And that would be a very big deal. If a sequester hits, the military budget would technically have go down from $716 billion to $576 billion - a cut of $140 billion. If the sequester kicks in, domestic spending would be trimmed from $605 billion to $542 billion. Ironically, because of the big increase that the GOP Congress was able to give to the Pentagon in 2017 and 2018, a sequester would hurt the military more than non-defense spending in 2020 and beyond. This is where the OCO funding (look above) comes into play - President Trump could allow the sequester to kick in, but still funnel more money to the Pentagon through that extra fund. One problem with that game plan is the GOP probably would not have 60 votes in the Senate to get that done. This may get pretty messy in the months ahead.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'New Roosevelt Bar shooting Feb. 22, 2013 5 Gallery: New Roosevelt Bar shooting Feb. 22, 2013\\n\\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Police at a hearing this week will try to make a case that recent violence at New Roosevelt Bar stems from poor management.\\n\\nThe Grand Rapids City Commission at 1 p.m. Tuesday, March 12, will be asked to recommend non-renewal of the Class C liquor license for the bar where a man was killed last year and where four people were shot last month. The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.\\n\\n“After the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,” said Lt. Richard Nawrocki, who commands the police departments vice unit. “Based upon the immediate community’s concerns, we believe it fits the criteria for the City Commission’s review for non-renewal.\\n\\n“We’re going to have to prove that the activities have some correlation to the bar here, and that’s what we will try to show.”\\n\\nRELATED: Grand Rapids police want to revoke liquor license for New Roosevelt Bar, where 4 were shot last month\\n\\nPolice say they have had to respond to incidents at 1447 Grandville Ave. SW more often since the bar got its liquor license in March 2012. The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.\\n\\nThe memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood.\\n\\n“We can’t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it’s the parking lot,” she said. “It’s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals. We want crime to stop in the Southwest Side, and I hope that once we close the violence will stop, but they haven’t arrested people in connection to any of the shootings.\\n\\n\"They are cutting the tree, but not the root (of the problem).\"\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED: Closing New Roosevelt Bar won\\'t eliminate police calls to the area\\n\\nJulie Niemchick, director of the Roosevelt Park Neighborhood Association, said she sympathizes with Rivera. Still, the neighborhood is tired of the violence and wants the bar to close, she said.\\n\\n“We can’t keep affording to have someone injured or murdered in our neighborhood,” Niemchick said. “We just can’t have that. We can’t tolerate it.\\n\\n“It’s the element that keeps showing up at their door that is the problem. If the bar isn’t open, then obviously there won’t be any violence there.”\\n\\nMLive reporter Sandra Chang contributed to this report.\\n\\nEmail Matt Vande Bunte, follow him on Twitter or be his friend on Facebook.',\n",

The Merced County District Attorney’s Office had charged Hernandez with first-degree, or premeditated, murder.\\n\\nThe jury of nine women and three men also found Hernandez guilty of firearm and weapons enhancements, but not guilty of three counts of attempted murder in connection with the same incident\\n\\nThe verdict came after a nearly three-week trial before Judge Ronald W.

Three other people were injured in the attack.\\n\\nProsecutors said Hernandez fired 10 rounds from a Ruger P89 pistol with an extended magazine into a crowd of about a dozen people. The group included several people Hernandez believed were rival gang members. Moore was not a gang member and, police said, not the intended target.\\n\\nThomas Min, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case, said he respected the jury’s verdict, saying, “I’m glad that Shane’s family will have some closure.”\\n\\nMoore’s family attended nearly every day of the trial, but asked for privacy.\\n\\nCo-defendant Christopher Aguayo pleaded guilty Oct. 2, 2013, to being an accessory in the killing and was sentenced to seven years in the state Division of Juvenile Justice. Aguayo, 16, was charged as an adult.\\n\\nHernandez’s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Chris Loethen, said that based on the conviction, the jury believed the defendant fired into a crowd of people, but did not intend to kill anyone.\\n\\n“But firing into a crowd is such an incredibly dangerous action that is likely to produce death or great bodily injury. That’s what this (verdict) indicates,” Loethen said after the verdict was read. “I’m thankful for the not guilty verdicts and the time and the effort and thought they (the jurors) put into this verdict.”\\n\\nJurors could not be reached for comment Friday.\\n\\nLoethen said an appeal is planned, and he intends to speak with Hernandez regarding a possible motion for a new trial.\\n\\nHansen ordered Hernandez to return to court March 28 for sentencing. The maximum possible prison sentence was not clear Friday.\\n\\nDuring the trial both attorneys focused heavily on Hernandez’s interview with Los Banos police detectives nearly three weeks after Moore’s death. With no physical evidence in the case, Hernandez’s statement was the key piece of evidence.\\n\\nProsecutors said Hernandez confessed to killing Moore unintentionally while firing at suspected rival gang members.\\n\\nThe defense called it a false confession and said Hernandez, who was 17 at the time but charged as an adult, only said he killed Moore because police convinced him it was the only way he would be able to see his family again. Prosecutors countered, saying falsely confessing to a murder made “no sense.”\\n\\nHernandez remains in custody in Merced County pending sentencing.',\n",

Eleven people were injured when gunmen opened fire in front of a crowd outside an apartment building. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nD.C. police announced on Thursday their first break in Monday’s early morning drive-by shooting on North Capitol Street, posting pictures of two 19-year-olds being sought in connection with the wounding of 13 people outside an apartment building.\\n\\nLate Thursday night, police announced that they had issued an arrest warrant for Craig Wilson for assault with intent to kill in connection with the mass shooting. Wilson has a revolver tattoo on his neck and is described as 6-foot-2 and weighing 140 pounds, authorities said.\\n\\nThe statement came hours after police officials identified Wilson and Andrew Davon Allen as people of interest in the case.\\n\\n“We’re trying to locate and interview two people we believe have information on the case,” Cmdr. George Kucik told reporters outside D.C. police headquarters in the afternoon.“We’re looking to see if anyone knows where they might be.”\\n\\nKucik had a message for the men: “Reach out to us. Come in and talk to us.”\\n\\nCraig Wilson (Courtesy of D.C. police)\\n\\nFive hours later, police announced the arrest warrant for Wilson but did not release details or why they considered Wilson a suspect.\\n\\nPolice also said they had located one of the two vehicles used in the shooting, which occurred about 2:10 a.m. on North Capitol Street, just off New York Avenue in front of an apartment complex called Tyler House.\\n\\nPolice haven’t found the other vehicle, Kucik said, described as a dark blue or black 1999 Mercedes-Benz CLK 320 coupe with D.C. license plates EF7810. Police have posted a $10,000 reward for anyone with information leading to an arrest and conviction.\\n\\nMost of the victims suffered minor wounds to their legs and arms, though one was struck in the lower back and critically injured.\\n\\nThe number of victims startled a city in which gun violence has been dropping. It occurred at the edge of a neighborhood transitioning into a gentrified district of condos, retail stores and offices. A name given by developers, NoMa, short for north of Massachusetts Avenue, has stuck.\\n\\nBut Monday’s violence and the fact that several victims, including three sisters, had just emerged from a mega-nightclub ignited old discussions over gentrification. A D.C. Council member proclaimed the area’s clubs, which existed before the latest burst of redevelopment, to be incompatible with the changing area, while a police commander pointed at crime from Tyler House, a subsidized tower of apartments.\\n\\nPolice have not described a motive, and they said little about the case Thursday. Authorities have indicated that they are looking into whether a dispute at the club precipitated the violence, or whether the incident is tied to long-standing beefs between neighborhood crews from Tyler House and those on the other side of New York Avenue in Truxton Circle.\\n\\n“There’s a lot to do in this case,” Kucik said. “We’re getting there.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Three Merced County youths have been arrested in connection with a suspected gang-related shooting last year at a house party near Atwater that left three teenagers dead, the Merced County Sheriff’s Department confirmed.\\n\\nGunfire erupted March 30, 2013, during an Easter holiday party in the area of the 9200 block of Westside Boulevard. Three people – Samantha Parreira, 16; Bernabed Hernandez-Canela, 18; and Matthew Fisher, 19 – were fatally shot and two other young people were injured. “Three young people were killed that night, and hopefully this will bring a little bit of closure, but we will never forget, ever forget,” said Desiree Parreira, Samantha’s mother.\\n\\nFamilies of the other victims could not be reached Thursday for comment.\\n\\nJose L. Botello and Jose M. Carballido, both 19-year-old Atwater residents, and Jacob Tellez, 18, of Merced, were arrested by detectives with the sheriff’s Major Crimes Unit this week on suspicion of murder and gang participation, Detective-Sgt. Chuck Hale said at a Thursday news conference.\\n\\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The Sacramento Bee content across all your devices. SAVE NOW #ReadLocal\\n\\nAll three suspects remained behind bars Thursday without bail.\\n\\nTellez was arrested early Thursday in San Jose. He was still going through the booking process Thursday afternoon and a mugshot was not immediately available. Botello and Carballido were arrested late Wednesday in Atwater. Both Atwater residents belong to the same criminal street gang, and Tellez is a member of another gang, Hale said.\\n\\nDetectives have not ruled out the possibility of making additional arrests. Deputies said the party started as a holiday gathering for high school students that escalated when word of the gathering spread through social media and text messages, attracting more than 100 people, including members of several Merced County street gangs.\\n\\nHale declined to comment on the specific incidents at the party that sparked the gun violence, saying releasing certain details, including the number of shooters or whether any murder weapons have been recovered, could harm the investigation. Cooperation from the public and witnesses was a critical factor in making the arrests, Hale said, although he stressed the need for additional help. “There are other people out there that have more information about this party and we invite them to come forward,” Hale said.\\n\\nDesiree Parreira pleaded for anyone with knowledge of the incident to reach out to sheriff’s investigators. “Don’t be scared,” she said Thursday. “If we keep running around being scared, these gangs are just going to take over and they’re going to take everybody away from us.”\\n\\nShe described her daughter as a “charismatic, go-getting” young lady who was close to her siblings. The family on Monday celebrated what would have been Samantha’s 18th birthday. She would have graduated from high school earlier this year. “We don’t get to share those things with her anymore. I don’t get to have that anymore and it’s not fair,” she said.“When she was taken from me, it just hardened my heart to know there’s people out there who’d take her away from us.”\\n\\nParreira’s aunt, Charlotte Alves, said she was “overjoyed” with news of the arrests. “My Sammie was such a good girl. Her smile could light up any room,” Alves said. “She had so much life, so many dreams that will never be accomplished now. This means so much.”\\n\\nSheriff Tom Cavallero praised the work of the detectives and deputies “who collaborated so well in this effort and were absolutely driven to bring about a resolution.”\\n\\nDesiree Parreira said the arrests sparked a range of emotions and hadn’t really “sunk in” yet. She said all the families want justice for their loved ones. “My daughter was 16 years old, and I’m never going to see her again because of these people,” she said. “I’ve learned to forgive, but I’ll never forget.”',\n",

It is awful that young people join gangs and think that they are doing something. Get a real job. Work for a living! Do the things the right way the way our forefathers set this country up. It pisses me off that we have N.Korea threatening our country and we are worried about protecting our territory from lowly, uneducated thugs who actually think people are scared of them because they wear a certain color. Territory and apartments that I wouldn\\'t let my dog live in by the way. Arrest all of these thugs and then get the parents for being negligent and not properly raising their kids.\\n\\n\\n\\nPosted: Friday, April 12, 2013\\n\\nArticle comment by: C. Kirk\\n\\n\\n\\nIts funny how everyone wants to blame everyone except the people actually involved. These shootings that have been happening are all gang related. If you\\'re a parent of one of these delinquents then you should know whether or not your child is in a gang. And if you dont then you\\'re not doing your job. If they\\'re living in your house which most of them probably are, then there should be no privacy. if you find guns, drugs or colors in their room then you need to act. if not, you\\'re just as guilty when they pull the trigger or get shot because they were wearing the wrong color or the drug deal goes south. And to all the people that know who is in a gang and dont report them, youre just as guilty. Gangs breed violence and crime. Nothing good comes of them and if you\\'re in one then you\\'re an idiot. If you want power and respect and a sense of pride, join the military, learn a trade. And if you really want to shoot someone then go infantry or marines. Law enforcement cant do it on their own. Ignorance, Fear and silence have a strangle hold on this community and it will ultimately rip us apart.\\n\\n\\n\\nPosted: Tuesday, April 9, 2013\\n\\nArticle comment by: Crystal Hawkins\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, I would like to say SORRY to families that have lost a loved on to this foolishness. I am a single parent of two teenagers (boy and girl). I try my very best to instill positive values that were taught to me by my grandparents, parents and numerous others. But, society today as a whole, has changed altogether. Yes, we say that we need role models and more people getting involved with the lives of theses children and I totally agree. Now, you have some parents that try to be their child\\'s friend rather than raise them. I do believe that there should be a bond between you and your children, but define your boundaries. Don\\'t uphold your children in their wrong doings, chastise them. Make it a priority to read and understand the Bible (ex. GOING TO CHURCH), have a family sit down meal, doing family outings, and pray together. Provide positive results is all that I am saying. Do not let them raise you!!!!! I remember when I was younger, if I even looked like I wanted to step out of line with my parents or grandparents, I would get dealt with then (and it was not a time out or punishment). Now, some of these parents do not want you to say anything to their children. If you do, then you are wrong. So, in my opinion only, this is what the result will be. Without GOD in our lives daily, we will never make it in this world. And again I say that this is just my OPINION....\\n\\n\\n\\nPosted: Monday, April 8, 2013\\n\\nArticle comment by: Mack Galphin\\n\\n\\n\\nPoverty + Drugs = Gangs\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you trace all of this back to it\\'s roots you will be researching 2 things........the Viet Nam War and the free trade agreements.

WARREN\\n\\nThe Associated Press\\n\\nGunfire erupted at a Federal Way apartment complex Sunday night where five people were shot to death, including a suspect who was shot by arriving officers, police said.\\n\\nOfficers responding to an emergency call at 9:30 p.m. at the Pine Village Apartments encountered a chaotic scene, with bullets flying.\\n\\n“When officers arrived there were still shots being fired,” said Federal Way police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock.\\n\\nThey found two wounded men on the ground in a parking lot. One of the men reached for a gun as police moved in to assist the two, she said.\\n\\nAt that point, officers opened fire. The suspect died but police said it wasn’t immediately clear if it was from their gunfire.\\n\\nThe other man on the ground and a third man in the parking lot were found dead.\\n\\nIn a search of the complex, police found a fourth man dead in one apartment and a slain woman in another unit. Schrock said police were trying to determine if the woman was hit by a stray bullet.\\n\\nA total of eight officers fired their weapons, Schrock said. All have been placed on administrative leave, per standard policy, as the investigation continues.\\n\\nThere was no immediate word what set off the shooting. Police scheduled a briefing for late Monday morning.\\n\\n“We still don’t have any idea what started this disturbance tonight,” Schrock said.\\n\\nAfter police flooded the area and carried out searches, authorities said they were confident there were no more casualties from the shooting.\\n\\nThey said they did not think another shooter was on the loose or that there was an immediate threat to the public.\\n\\nThere were no reports of any officers being injured. The names of the five people killed were not immediately available.\\n\\nOfficers were using a metal detector to search a grassy bank across the street from the apartment complex this morning.\\n\\nKristina Braun, 23, said she, her husband and 3-year-old daughter went to the movies and dinner yesterday, arriving about home 9:30 p.m.\\n\\n“We saw and heard a ton of ambulances and police cars everywhere,” she said this morning.\\n\\nHer family was still not allowed to return to their apartment this morning, awaiting police to give the OK.\\n\\n“It’s actually really calm, normally … This is the first huge issue,” said Braun, who’s lived in the complex for two years. She said about 6 months ago, a lot of police showed up for the robbery at a nearly grocery.\\n\\nSung Yang, who runs a motel nearby, said he and residents heard the gunfire.\\n\\n“I heard gunshots. Lot of gunshots. It was scary,” Yang said.\\n\\nThere was a series of shots at first and then after about 10 minutes, more shooting, he said.\\n\\n“Everybody staying here came out to see what it was,” but they got little information.\\n\\n“I’ve lived here five and a half or six years and I’ve never had a problem. I just don’t understand it.” said Kelly Burki, a resident of the complex.\\n\\nBurki, 51, was out for the evening and was returning home about 11 p.m. to find her street closed by police. She said she was told she could return home in a couple of hours, but at 8 a.m today, police still had the street closed.\\n\\nBurki said she is a bartender who frequently doesn’t get home until around 2:30 a.m. “But even at that hour, I’ve always felt safe. I’ve never fear.”\\n\\nSeattle Times staff reporter Jack Broom contributed to this report.',\n",

The jury deliberated for about a half hour before returning with the verdict on the reckless endangerment and tampering with evidence charges. On April 28 around 3:05 a.m., police were called to a shooting at Wolfe Enterprises at 438 E. Main Street. Officers arrived to find Banes and Clark, both 31, of Jackson, with apparent gunshot wounds. They were transported to Jackson-Madison County General Hospital where they were later pronounced dead. Two other gunshot victims arrived at the hospital via personal vehicles. The investigation determined there was an argument on the parking lot of 438 E. Main Street as a party was letting out. Berry was allegedly the first person to fire a semi-automatic handgun into the air while he was standing in a crowd of people. Anthony Montrell Swift, of Jackson, is accused of shooting Brian Banes and Delandis Clark multiple times. After the shootings, police said that Berry left the scene and disposed of the weapon that he fired. Swift will be on trial on March 25.',\n",

Police said the shots were fired just after 10 p.m.\\n\\nNeighbors said the all-day gathering outside on the street involved alcohol — and kids were outside, too.\\n\\nIt was not clear early today whether the shooter was carrying the gun during the vigil or left and came back with the weapon. Police said the shooter apparently exited a dark-colored vehicle, fired several shots, got back in the car, and fled.\\n\\nThe five injured people were taken to area hospitals where they were all listed in stable condition - and four were released by noon today, police said. The 10-year-old girl was shot in the ankle, a 22-year-old woman was shot in the buttocks, a 46-year-old woman and 25-year-old man were shot in the arm, and a 48-year-old man was wounded in both legs.\\n\\nNo arrests have been made.\\n\\nPeople were drinking alcohol on the street all day, and there were kids around during that time, said one neighbor.\\n\\n\"They were out there drinking all day long — that\\'s probably what heated the whole thing up,\" said Millie Rivera, a neighbor who moved to the street last August — and plans to move out in July.\\n\\n2 trchristie HINDASH.JPG\\n\\nCONNECT WITH US\\n\\nOn mobile or desktop:\\n\\n• Like The Star-Ledger on Facebook\\n\\n• Follow @starledger on Twitter\\n\\nAnd check out our redesigned mobile site by visiting NJ.com from any mobile browser.\\n\\nThe vigil was for a man who had died in a single-vehicle crash some six blocks away on Clinton Place, the sources said.\\n\\nThe driver of the vehicle had apparently lost control of the car at 4 a.m. Thursday, and struck a residence at 19 Clinton Place, said city police spokesman Sgt.

The unidentified man was rushed to University Hospital where he later died from his injuries.\\n\\nThe exact circumstances surrounding the accident were unclear, said Glover early Thursday.\\n\\nOn South 16th Street, a person this morning shouted out at reporters who had gathered.\\n\\n\"It was my family!\" he shouted. \"Get... up out my house. You only come out here when something happens.\\n\\n\"We\\'re killing each other out here!\" he added.\\n\\nNeighbors on the street said there has been a run of local crime in recent years — robberies, thefts, shootings and a stabbing - which has changed the neighborhood. Several abandoned houses are scattered along the street.\\n\\n\"My family\\'s been here 40 years,\" said Dwayne Morris. \"This used to be a beautiful block.\"\\n\\n\"This is a crazy block,\" Rivera said. \"That\\'s why I\\'m moving off the street.

The child was injured after falling as she ran away, he said. The grandmother and child are not associated with the other victims, he said.

The car stopped directly in front of the bus stop, then several shots were fired at the victims from the inside of the vehicle.\\n\\nPolice are currently assessing video from nearby businesses, Cook said. The Cinco de Mayo Day shootings follow a Saturday night incident, in which a man was shot in the torso on Pulgas Street. Cook said the vehicle in that shooting appears to be larger and different.\\n\\nCook said he did not know how many shots were fired, but some casings were found on Gloria Way.\\n\\nPolice from Palo Alto and Menlo Park also arrived on scene and cordoned off Bay Road and McDonald's from University Avenue to Gloria Way. Menlo Park firefighters arrived on scene to treat the victims, finding some inside the McDonald's and some outside.\\n\\nCook said all were shot outside, but two ran into the restaurant after being struck. No one was injured inside.\\n\\nMenlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said most of the injuries were to the victims' lower extremities. One man in his 20s had more serious injuries.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Two men who opened fire during a 7th Ward Mother\\'s Day parade in 2013, leaving 20 people injured, pleaded guilty to federal charges Wednesday (Sept. 9).\\n\\nBrothers Akein \"Keemy\" Scott and Shawn \"Shizzle\" Scott entered guilty pleas to racketeering and conspiracy charges, as well as counts related to a total of five shootings they committed as members of \"FnD,\" a street gang that took its name from the intersection of the Frenchmen and Derbigny streets.\\n\\nThe Mother\\'s Day shooting, in which 19 people were struck by gunshots as the Scott brothers fired at a rival gang member, was one of five shootings committed by FnD members.\\n\\nThe brothers entered their pleas standing alongside a third brother, 23-year-old Stanley \"Stizzle\" Scott, in U.S. District Judge Ivan Lemelle\\'s courtroom. Each of the three face 20 years to life in prison when they are sentenced in January.\\n\\nTheir joint plea deals with prosecutors do not require them to testify against the lone FnD member still facing trial, their older brother, Travis \"Trap\" Scott, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Payne said. Travis Scott is set to go to trial next month as the alleged leader of FnD.\\n\\nNew Orleans Police say Akein Scott, 22, and Shawn Scott, 26, took up positions on opposite sides of Frenchmen Street as the May 12, 2013 parade passed near North Villere Street, and opened fire at a rival gang member, identified in court records by the initials \"J.T.\"\\n\\nThe melee was retaliation for a prior shooting that wounded Stanley Scott by members of the Prieur and Columbus Boys, a rival gang also known as \"PCB,\" police said.\\n\\nNineteen bystanders were wounded, including J.T., who was struck five times, according to court records filed along with Akein, Stanley and Shawn Scott\\'s guilty pleas. Another person was trampled as panicked parade-goers fled the shooting.\\n\\nProsecutors allege FnD members trafficked heroin and crack cocaine in the 7th Ward dating back to 2006. Nine FnD members, most of them members of the Scott family, were charged in a federal indictment in 2014.\\n\\nSurveillance video showed the densely packed crowd along the parade route scattering amid the gunshots, images that shocked even city residents accustomed to occasional outbreaks of violence along parade routes.\\n\\nAmong the those struck by bullets were two 10-year-old children, who suffered graze wounds. The shooter shown in the video, according to court records, was then 20-year-old Akein Scott.\\n\\nIn the weeks that followed, organizers hosted a \"do over\" of the parade and multiple fundraisers were held for the injured even as police conducted a manhunt for the shooting suspects.\\n\\nIn court records, FnD members who have pleaded guilty have admitted to selling drugs over a territory bounded by Elysian Fields Avenue, North Johnson, Interstate 10, St. Anthony Street and North Claiborne Avenue.\\n\\nThe center of the gang\\'s operation was the Frenchmen Meat Market, where workers would hold guns behind the counter for FnD members, and would let patrons swap food stamps for cash that they then handed over to FnD members for heroin or crack.\\n\\nSurveillance video from the store\\'s own cameras was noted as evidence prosecutors intended to use at trial, with footage showing FnD members making numerous drug deals inside the store.\\n\\nTravis Scott often carried an AK-47 rifle he called \"monkey nuts,\" a reference to the massive drum magazine that could hold 100 rounds, according to court records.\\n\\nAkein Scott, now 22, sold drugs at the store several days a week, mostly in the afternoon after returning from school, one unnamed witness said in court records. As one of the younger members of the gang, Akein often was told to hang onto firearms for older gang members, because as a juvenile, he would face less serious penalties from authorities if he was caught with the weapons.\\n\\nIn court records, Akein Scott admitted to pulling the trigger himself in four shootings during the year before the 2013 Mother\\'s Day parade, joining Shawn and Stanley Scott in a shootout in front of the Frenchmen Meat Market in which a 14-year-old girl riding in a passing vehicle was shot in the leg.\\n\\nOn Mother\\'s Day 2013, Akein Scott is seen on surveillance video as the second-line parade moves down the block, stepping out from the side of a building with a pistol raised and firing into the terrified marchers, according to court records.\\n\\nWhen asked about his background by Judge Lemelle on Wednesday, Akein Scott was the only one of the brothers to have completed high school, stating that he attended college in \"Talladega\" and studied business administration. His lawyer, Julie Tizzard, said Akein Scott had been enrolled in college when he was arrested in 2014.\\n\\nStay with NOLA.com for more on this developing story.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A Camden County man facing numerous charges in connection with an altercation with a Delanco police officer in 2013 during which both were shot was found not guilty by reason of insanity.\\n\\nEugene Taylor, 26, of Clementon, appeared before Superior Court Judge Charles Delehey on Thursday at the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly for a bench trial so the judge could determine his competence when the incident occurred.\\n\\nAccording to comments in court, Delanco police officer Francisco Ambrifi responded to a 911 call about 3:45 a.m. on May 14, 2013, reporting a man who was possibly under the influence screaming in the area of Delaware Avenue.\\n\\nTaylor allegedly appeared \"zoned out\" and in a \"religiously-disoriented state\" and made comments that \"you\\'re going to see Jesus tonight,\" Delehey read from accounts of the incident. The judge noted that he was not making any finding of fact, but rather simply summarizing what was alleged to have happened.\\n\\nAfter the officer sprayed Taylor with mace there was a scuffle and Taylor was shot four times and the officer once in the leg with his own weapon. Court documents indicated that Taylor was alleged to have jumped in front of Ambrifi\\'s patrol car.\\n\\nIn 2015, Taylor filed a civil lawsuit against Ambrifi, the municipality and others in U.S. District Court in Camden that is still pending, according to court records. In the suit, Taylor alleged that Ambrifi was not properly trained and had used excessive force against him during the altercation.\\n\\nTaylor, who has been in jail since June 2013, had lost an appeal in July to have the indictment dismissed because the grand jury did not consider his mental issues. A psychological evaluation determined that Taylor is schizophrenic and family and friends said he became obsessed with religion and even death in the days before the incident, according to court documents.\\n\\nA trial date had been set for January, but Taylor opted instead for the bench trial. Before Delehey ruled that Taylor was not guilty because he was mentally incapacitated during the incident, did not understand the nature of his conduct, and could not determine right from wrong, the state and defense agreed to certain conditions.\\n\\nBurlington County Assistant Prosecutor Thaddeus Drummond said the state agreed to dismiss all counts of the indictment, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, except for a third-degree offense of resisting arrest. That was the only offense considered by the judge during the trial.\\n\\nAlso, both sides agreed that Taylor will be sent to a psychiatric facility under what is known as Krol status until June 2018 and will waive his right for two years after that to challenge any finding by mental health professionals that he continue to be committed if he is deemed a risk to himself or others.\\n\\nThose on Krol status are evaluated annually by a judge to determine if they are a danger to themselves or society and should remain committed.',\n",

Brown, Robinson left a sweet sixteen party on the night of May 18, 2013 and boarded a Q6 bus at the corner of Sutphin and Rockaway boulevards. Capers and a second gunman — Kevin McClinton, then 21, of Rosedale — were outside the bus at the time.\\n\\nShortly after Robinson took her seat in the rear of the bus, police said, Capers pulled out a handgun and fired five shots at the vehicle. McClinton then grabbed the gun and pulled the trigger four more times.

       "  'title': 'Shooter Accepts 25 Year Prison Sentence for Wounding 4 Men in Lunenburg County',\n",
       "  'publish_date': '',\n",
       "  'text': 'Codarrell Lee Yates, a 22-year-old man from Nottoway County, pled guilty recently in Lunenburg Circuit Court to four felony wounding charges, one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a felon and was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. He received an additional 93 years suspended upon numerous conditions.\\n\\nYates also has an additional five years to serve on Nottoway County convictions this year for grand larceny and breaking and entering.\\n\\nAccording to Commonwealth Attorney Robert Clement, a jury trial was planned for November 4th and 5th, but the defendant expressed a willingness to plead guilty in exchange for an agreed-upon sentence. Clement said that he would have preferred a more significant sentence, but due to a “snitch” mentality among nearly all of the witnesses, he felt more secure with a “sure thing” rather than having to count upon reluctant, uncooperative witnesses. “Some refused to talk to law enforcement, and some refused to meet with me,” said Clement. The prosecutor did, however, highly commend one of the victims, Standrekas Woods, for his full cooperation, precise observations, and ability to express his testimony fully and forcefully. Clement added that the victims and law enforcement officers agreed to the disposition.\\n\\n“Ironically, those persons who did not want to “snitch” did not realize that Yates “snitched” on one of his closest friends, Robert “Chuckie” Fields, the driver of the vehicle. In his interview in Texas where he was found after the shooting, Yates said he had left the party before the shootings, and that Fields had given him the gun to take to Texas later that day. He said Fields admitted to him in a telephone conversation that Fields had shot the men.\\n\\nFields, on the other hand, would not identify Yates as the shooter in his first four interviews until he was shown the video of Yates in Texas blaming him for the shooting. Fields then went ballistic, calling Yates a liar and saying Yates was the shooter. He then looked right into the camera in the interview room and shouted, “You’re (deleted) whacked. You are lying. You’re supposed to be my (deleted) brother, man.” He told the investigator to be sure she showed Yates the video of this interview. “Don’t let him miss it.” He then raised his hands up, showing the handcuffs to the camera, and said, “It’s because of you.””\\n\\nYates will be under conditions of good behavior for 118 years, supervised probation for five years upon his release, warrant-less searches and seizures, no contact with the victims, restitution for any medical expenses, not knowingly being within 100 feet of any firearms except law enforcement officers and commercial establishments, and staying out of Lunenburg County for ten years upon his release.\\n\\nAccording to Clement, the charges arose from a shooting at 2073 Pleasant Oak Road, Victoria, Virginia after physical altercations between Lunenburg men and Nottoway men during a birthday party for a Lunenburg female on May 18, 2013.\\n\\nDetails provided below were taken from a written Stipulation of Evidence signed by the defendant as to what he expected the Commonwealth to prove in court, revealed the following facts:\\n\\nAll witnesses would have been in agreement that Richsean Hawkes hosted a birthday party cookout for Destiny Brown, a friend. Approximately 25 to 35 individuals eventually showed up.\\n\\nA number of the witnesses became aware that around 11:30 p.m., Robert “Chuckie” Fields drove up in his father’s minivan with six friends from Nottoway. (Fields is the father of the baby of Destiny Brown). A number of the witnesses expressed concern that the “Nottoway” men had come to the party, because of past tensions with Lunenburg County individuals. They would testify that Brandon Townsend of Lunenburg stood on the front porch at one point and angrily yelled at one of the Nottoway men, “What are you looking at?” because of the manner and stance that the Nottoway man posed. Townsend was convinced by some of the women to go back into the house, but came out later and fussed again. One of the Nottoway men yelled something to the effect of not being disrespected in this way. As some of the Lunenburg and Nottoway men became more aggressive, some of the Lunenburg men and women tried to defuse the situation and calm them down. Two of these men who tried to calm things down were the victims, Stan Woods and Dequan Jones. Witnesses would say that Dequan Jones was then jumped and hit from the side, and then fought back. As he was fighting, another Nottoway man tried to get him, but a Lunenburg man pushed him away, and said words to the effect that it would have to be a fair fight, one on one. He pushed the Nottoway man twice to stop him, and they ended up in the road in front of the house. They squared off with each other to fight, and the Lunenburg man hit him in the face with one punch and knocked him out. Stan encouraged Chuckie Fields to get his friend and leave. Chuckie dragged his friend to the minivan, put him inside, and the other Nottoway men got inside also.\\n\\n(Some of the Nottoway men said the minivan was surrounded and being hit and kicked, but none of the Commonwealth’s Lunenburg witnesses confirmed this.)\\n\\nAt this point, shots were fired. Five or six witnesses would testify that the shots came from inside the minivan which was parked at the back of the driveway facing the house, with five shots fired through the windshield, and two more shots fired from the side after the van had backed into the road and as it drove away.\\n\\nThe four victims were hit by the gunfire as described below.\\n\\nStandrekas “Stan” Woods is a 2009 graduate of Central High School, and attended one year at the local community college before becoming a correctional officer for the Virginia Department of Corrections.\\n\\nStan said that around 11:00 pm or 11:30 p.m., his friend, Richsean Hawkes, called and asked him to come to his house and drive him to town to buy some cigarettes because he had been drinking and did not want to drive. When he came back, he sat on the porch talking to Hawkes and one of the Nottoway men in friendly conversation.\\n\\nWhen the arguments began, Stan stopped one Lunenburg man from being aggressive toward the Nottoway man who had been on the porch, pointing out that he had not done anything.\\n\\nStan then went to get his younger brother, Dontaris, in order to leave. He saw the fights described above, and peacefully encouraged the Nottoway men to leave. He and his brother walked to his car in the driveway where it was parked just in front of the minivan. He walked around the front of the car, and Dontaris walked behind the car calling out for a friend who had ridden with him. His car was parked on the road further beyond the driveway.\\n\\nStan said that as he put the key in lock to the door of his car, he heard two shots, and saw his brother, Dontaris, fall to the ground. He then turned and looked at the minivan, saw two bullet holes in the windshield, and plainly saw the defendant, Codarrell Yates, pointing a handgun toward him from inside the minivan from the back, reaching between the two front seats. The ceiling light was on just above his face, giving Stan a good view of Yates. Stan said Yates yelled, “THAT’S HOW YA’LL WANT TO PLAY ? AIN’T NO REASON TO RUN NOW.”\\n\\nStan said he could see Chuckie (Robert Fields) in the driver’s seat, and the light-skinned guy in the passenger seat.\\n\\nStan said YATES looked at him dead in the face, pointing the gun at him.\\n\\nSTAN yelled “NO!!!” and saw and heard the shot fired by Yates and felt the bullet hit him in the chest.\\n\\nSTAN sank down by the car, and played dead. He said he heard two more shots, and then a few seconds later he heard two more shots down the road just as the van accelerated and drove away.\\n\\nStan looked up and saw they were gone. He said he ran around the car and went up to the sidewalk where he fell.\\n\\nA friend and other Lunenburg men and women got shirts, towels and sheets and applied pressure to the wounds of the four victims.\\n\\nStan said he looked up at the moon, which was nearly full, and thought, “This is the last moon I’m going to see.”\\n\\nStan was driven to the hospital in South Hill along with Trey Ghee, who had been injured. Dequan Jones and Dontaris Woods were driven to the Victoria Rescue Squad and transported to South Hill. All four men were then transported to MCV Hospital in Richmond.\\n\\nDequan Jones also attended Central High School. He would testify concerning the fighting described above, and said he then walked over to his car which was parked a little further up the driveway in front of Stan. He would testify that he heard the gunfire and turned to look, but then turned back to the person he had been talking to. He then suddenly felt a burning pain to his right ear. It turned out that a bullet had cut his earlobe and either the same bullet or a second bullet entered the side of his head at the ear while his head was turned sideways. He said he did not see the shooting itself.\\n\\nDontaris Woods apparently was the first man shot, but said he did not see the shooting itself. He was struck in the face and in his left arm near the wrist.\\n\\nTreyvious Ghee said he came out of the house and saw the fighting going on. As he and a friend were walking in the yard, he was hit in the side of his head, just above his ear. He fell to the ground unconscious. He also did not see the shooter.\\n\\nFemale Witness, who will not be identified here at her request, said that she saw a man standing in the minivan “with hair” (referring, she said, to long braids, like the defendant had) shooting from the side of the minivan as it drove away.\\n\\nRobert “Chuckie” Fields was the man who drove the Nottoway men to the party. He is charged as an accomplice (for driving the vehicle as the last shots were fired and getting away from the scene, allowing Yates to flee). He is charged with the same crimes as Yates, except for the possession of a firearm by a felon.\\n\\nFields was interviewed by law enforcement at least four times, refusing to identify the shooter, at times stating he just heard the shots and ducked down in the driver’s seat, and stating that one of the friends was still unconscious from being knocked out in the fight, and another friend in the front passenger seat fainted when the first shot rang out. He always strongly denied that he had shot the gun. He later said that the police knew who had shot the gun, but he would not say the name.\\n\\nIn exchange for his agreement to testify against Yates and his agreement to waive the preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth has agreed to allow Fields to plead guilty to one count of malicious wounding as an accomplice and receive one year active sentence.\\n\\nYates fled to Texas later in the day, driven by a female friend, Deidre Fowlkes. When found by law enforcement officers in Arlington, Texas, Yates ran on foot, and tried to hide in some brush. A tracking dog was used, and he was found lying in some tall grass. At first he would not get up as commanded, but when police threatened to release the dog, he jumped up. He said he had fled to Texas to avoid a sentencing hearing in Nottoway Circuit Court on a conviction of burglary the Monday after the party.',\n",

Teutonia Ave., police said Saturday.\\n\\nThe four victims have been hospitalized for non-life threatening injuries, Capt. Donald Gaglione said. The motive for the shooting is under investigation, he said.\\n\\nThe incident happened overnight Friday into Saturday. A news release from Milwaukee police did not indicate a specific time of the shooting.\\n\\nLake Superior water level jumps in May\\n\\nA new report says the level of Lake Superior has made a big jump.\\n\\nThe International Lake Superior Board of Control reported Friday that the level of Lake Superior jumped 9 inches in May. That\\'s more than twice the normal monthly increase and the second most for any month since 1918.\\n\\nLake Superior usually rises only about 4 inches each May. But thanks to late snow and a cold spring that held back runoff, May more than made up for the difference.\\n\\nThe lake now sits just 7 inches below its long-term average for June 1. It is a full 3 inches above the level at this time last year.\\n\\nThe Duluth News Tribune reports Lakes Huron and Michigan also continued their rise from near-record lows in late winter.\\n\\nDeath of toddler probed in West Allis\\n\\nWest Allis police late Saturday were investigating the death of a 21-month-old child.\\n\\nPolice were called to a mobile home in the 10300 block of W. Greenfield Ave. at 4:15 p.m. for an unresponsive child.\\n\\nAttempts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful.\\n\\nPolice and the Milwaukee County medical examiner\\'s office are investigating.\\n\\nNo other details were provided.\\n\\nPolice arrest man for making threat\\n\\nA 39-year-old man accused of making a threat to a Greenfield resident was taken into custody Saturday by Oak Creek police.\\n\\nThe alleged threat was made about 10 a.m. Police said the man ran into a residence in the 2100 block of W. College Ave. and refused to comply with orders from Oak Creek police officers.\\n\\nAfter contacting the man on the phone, officers persuaded him to come out of the house.\\n\\nHe was taken into custody and will be medically evaluated, police said.\\n\\nThe Milwaukee County district attorney\\'s office will review the case to determine if charges are warranted.\\n\\nFree swim lessons offered at Wilson Park\\n\\nThe Milwaukee County Park System and the Southwest Aquatic Team\\'s Swim America Program are offering free Milwaukee County pool open swim summer passes for the first 200 swimmers who register for lessons at the Wilson Park Pool, near W. Howard Ave. and S. 25th St. in Milwaukee.\\n\\nThose who sign up will also get a free swimming cap and a free pair of goggles.\\n\\nDale Schrank, the program\\'s director, said he hopes the lessons at Wilson Park Pool will encourage minority youths to learn swimming, as African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately represented in drowning deaths. He said Swim America would like to offer lessons at more locations attracting minorities.\\n\\nParents who would like to register their children can send checks to SWAT Swim America, P.O. Box 138, Muskego, WI 53150. Alternatively, they can register in person on June 4 or June 6 at the Wilson Park and Recreation Center from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. For more information on the lessons, email swatt@execpc.com or call (262) 971-1658.\\n\\nIllinois firm to provide cream puff ingredient\\n\\nWisconsin State Fair-goers may be surprised to learn the main ingredient in a favorite fair treat no longer comes from the dairy state.\\n\\nThe Wisconsin Bakers\\' Association has turned to an Illinois company to provide the cream that makes the fair\\'s cream puffs so popular. Prairie Farms Dairy of Carlinville, Ill., won a contract to supply the cream after Golden Guernsey went out of business in Wisconsin.\\n\\nThe Bakers\\' Association found no Wisconsin company could handle the daily demand of 1,200 gallons of cream.\\n\\nState Fair spokeswoman Kristi Chuckel told WISN-TV that Prairie Farms has pledged to work with Wisconsin dairy farms to supply the cream. But, for fairgoer Jeff Fink, it just leaves a bad taste in his mouth.\\n\\nFink equates it to the Packers moving to Illinois. He says \"there\\'s something just not right about it.\"\\n\\nTraffic stop reveals heroin, drugs in car\\n\\nA Milwaukee woman faces felony drug charges after her car was stopped for a traffic violation in Racine County, where police say they found marijuana, pills and about $4,500 worth of heroin in her car.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old woman — who was a passenger in her vehicle, being driven by someone else — was not identified in a news release from Racine County Sheriff\\'s Office. She is being held in the Racine County jail on charges of possession of marijuana, possession of a controlled substance and possession of heroin with intent to deliver.\\n\\nAccording to the release, a deputy stopped the car on northbound I-94 early Saturday for an unspecified traffic violation. The deputy smelled burned marijuana, searched the vehicle and found the drugs.\\n\\nThe driver was not charged and was released.\\n\\nDeSoto campsites closed temporarily\\n\\nDeSoto — A southwestern Wisconsin park is offering only limited camping this weekend due to minor flooding.\\n\\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Blackhawk Park near DeSoto has extremely wet conditions.\\n\\nIn addition, the Corps will close sites 40 to 73 of the West Loop Camping Area Monday through Thursday to do maintenance work.\\n\\nThe Corps said with the flooding and this closure, the number of campsites at Blackhawk Park will be limited. Campers should contact park staff before planning a camping trip.\\n\\nThe Corps plans to reopen the West Loop for next weekend and other sites as river levels recede and conditions improve.\\n\\nJournal Sentinel staff and wires',\n",
